 IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard
Preface to the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard
This Preface sets out the scope and authority of the IFRS for SMEs Accounting
Standard and describes how the Standard is maintained.
The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) was established in 2001.
The IASB was preceded by the board of the International Accounting
Standards Committee.
Full IFRS® Accounting Standards and the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard
are developed through an international due process set out in the IFRS
Foundation’s Due Process Handbook.
Scope and authority of the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard
The IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard is designed to apply to the general
purpose financial statements and other financial reporting of profit-oriented
entities that jurisdictions often refer to as small and medium-sized entities,
private entities or non-publicly accountable entities.
Other financial reporting comprises information provided outside financial
statements that assists in the interpretation of a complete set of financial
statements or improves users’ ability to make efficient economic decisions.
Profit-oriented entities include those engaged in commercial, industrial,
financial and similar activities, whether organised in corporate form or in
other forms.
The term small and medium-sized entities (or SMEs) as used by the IASB is
defined and explained in Section 1 Small and Medium-sized Entities. Many
jurisdictions have developed their own definitions of SMEs for a broad range
of purposes, including prescribing financial reporting requirements.
Definitions that are specific to a particular jurisdiction often include
quantified criteria based on revenue, assets, employees or other factors.
Furthermore, the term SMEs is often used to mean or to include very small
entities, without regard to whether they publish general purpose financial
statements for external users.
The IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard sets out recognition, measurement,
presentation and disclosure requirements for transactions and events that are
important in general purpose financial statements. It also sets out such
requirements for transactions and events that arise mainly in specific
industries.
The IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard is based on full IFRS Accounting
Standards with modifications to reflect the needs of users of SMEs’ financial
statements and to reflect cost–benefit considerations relevant for SMEs and
the users of their financial statements.

statements is to provide financial information about a reporting entity that is
useful to existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors in
making decisions relating to providing resources to the entity.
SMEs often produce financial statements only for the use of owner-managers
or only for the use of tax authorities or other governmental authorities.
Financial statements produced solely for those purposes are not necessarily
general purpose financial statements.
Tax laws are specific to each jurisdiction, and the objectives of general
purpose financial statements differ from the objectives of reporting taxable
profit. Thus, financial statements prepared in conformity with the IFRS for
SMEs Accounting Standard are unlikely to comply fully with all of the
measurements required by a particular jurisdiction’s tax laws and regulations.
A jurisdiction may be able to lessen the dual reporting burden on SMEs by
requiring or permitting an entity’s tax reports to be structured as
reconciliations from the profit or loss determined in accordance with the IFRS
for SMEs Accounting Standard or by other means.
Authority of the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard
Decisions on which entities are required or permitted to use full IFRS
Accounting Standards or the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard rest with the
legislative and regulatory authorities and standard-setters in individual
jurisdictions. However, a clear definition of the class of entity for which the
IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard is intended—as set out in Section 1 of the
Standard—is essential so that:
(a)
the IASB can decide on the recognition, measurement, presentation
and disclosure requirements that are appropriate for that class of
entity; and
(b)
the legislative and regulatory authorities, standard-setters and
reporting entities and their auditors will be informed of the intended
scope of applicability of the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard.
A clear definition is also essential so that entities that are not small or
medium-sized entities—as set out in Section 1 of the Standard—and therefore
are not eligible to use the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard, do not assert
that their financial statements are in compliance with the Standard (see
paragraph 1.5).
Organisation of the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard
The IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard is organised by topic, with each topic
presented in a separate numbered section. Cross-references to paragraphs are
identified by section number followed by paragraph number. Paragraph
numbers are in the form xx.yy, in which xx is the section number and yy is
the sequential paragraph number within that section. In examples that

 include monetary amounts, the measuring unit is Currency Units (abbreviated
as CU).
All of the paragraphs in the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard have equal
authority (except as specified in paragraph 2.2). Some sections include
appendices of application guidance, which are an integral part of the section,
and some sections include appendices of illustrative examples, which
accompany but are not part of the section. Appendices A and B are an integral
part of the Standard. The definitions in the Glossary in Appendix B are
integral to the sections in which the terms appear.
Maintenance of the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard
The IASB expects to propose amendments to the IFRS for SMEs Accounting
Standard by publishing an exposure draft periodically, but not more
frequently than approximately once every three years. In developing those
exposure drafts, the IASB expects to consider new and amended full IFRS
Accounting Standards as well as specific issues that have been brought to its
attention regarding the application of the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard.
On occasion, the IASB may identify an urgent matter for which amendment of
the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard may need to be considered outside the
periodic review process. However, such occasions are expected to be rare.
Until the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard is amended, any changes that the
IASB may make or propose with respect to full IFRS Accounting Standards do
not apply to the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard. The IFRS for SMEs
Accounting Standard is a stand-alone document. SMEs shall not anticipate or
apply changes made to full IFRS Accounting Standards before the IFRS for SMEs
Accounting Standard is amended unless, in the absence of specific guidance in
the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard, an SME chooses to apply guidance in
full IFRS Accounting Standards and those principles do not conflict with
requirements in the hierarchy set out in paragraphs 10.4–10.5.

 IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard
Section 1
Small and Medium-sized Entities
Intended scope of this Standard
The IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard is intended for use by entities without
public accountability, which are referred to as small and medium-sized
entities (SMEs) in this Standard. This section describes the characteristics of
SMEs.
Description of small and medium-sized entities
Small and medium-sized entities are entities that:
(a)
do not have public accountability; and
(b)
publish general purpose financial statements for external users.
Examples of external users include existing and potential investors, lenders
and other creditors, and credit rating agencies.
An entity has public accountability if:
(a)
its debt or equity instruments are traded in a public market or it is in
the process of issuing such instruments for trading in a public market
(a domestic or foreign stock exchange or an over-the-counter market,
including local and regional markets); or
(b)
it holds assets in a fiduciary capacity for a broad group of outsiders as
one of its primary businesses (for example, banks, credit unions,
insurance companies, securities brokers/dealers, mutual funds and
investment banks often meet this second criterion).
Some entities may also hold assets in a fiduciary capacity for a broad group of
outsiders because they hold and manage financial resources entrusted to them
by clients, customers or members not involved in the management of the
entity. However, if they do so for reasons incidental to a primary business (as,
for example, may be the case for travel or real estate agents, schools,
charitable organisations, co-operative enterprises requiring a nominal
membership deposit and sellers that receive payment in advance of delivery of
the goods or services such as utility companies), that does not make them
publicly accountable.
If a publicly accountable entity applies this Standard, its financial statements
shall not be described as conforming to the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard
—even if a law or regulation in that entity’s jurisdiction permits or requires
this Standard to be used by publicly accountable entities.

 A subsidiary whose parent applies full IFRS Accounting Standards, or that is
part of a consolidated group that applies full IFRS Accounting Standards, is
not prohibited from applying this Standard in its own financial statements if
that subsidiary by itself does not have public accountability. If its financial
statements are described as conforming to the IFRS for SMEs Accounting
Standard, it must comply with all of the requirements of this Standard.
A parent entity (including the ultimate parent or any intermediate parent)
assesses its eligibility to apply this Standard in its separate financial
statements on the basis of its own status without considering whether other
group entities have, or the group as a whole has, public accountability. If a
parent entity by itself does not have public accountability, it may present its
separate financial statements in accordance with this Standard (see Section 9
Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements), even if it presents its
consolidated financial statements in accordance with full IFRS Accounting
Standards or another set of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP),
such as its national accounting standards. Any financial statements prepared
in accordance with this Standard shall be clearly distinguished from financial
statements prepared in accordance with other requirements.

 Section 2
Concepts and Pervasive Principles
Scope of this section
This section describes the objective of financial statements of small and
medium-sized entities (SMEs). It also sets out the concepts and basic
principles underlying the financial statements of SMEs.
The concepts and principles in this section might not always align with the
requirements in other sections of the Standard. In those cases, the
requirements in the other sections take precedence over the concepts and
principles in this section.
The objective of financial statements of small and medium-sized
entities
Objective, usefulness and limitations of general purpose
financial statements
The objective of an entity’s general purpose financial statements is to
provide financial information about the reporting entity that is useful to
existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors when making
decisions related to providing resources to the entity.1
Useful information about a reporting entity includes information about:
(a)
the economic resources of the entity, claims against the entity and
changes in those resources and claims; and
(b)
how efficiently and effectively the entity’s management has met its
responsibilities to use the entity’s economic resources.
However, general purpose financial statements do not and cannot provide all
the information that existing and potential investors, lenders and other
creditors consider when making decisions. These users of an entity’s general
purpose financial statements (users) also consider pertinent information from
other sources—for example, general economic conditions and expectations,
political events, and industry and company outlooks.2

other creditors who must rely on general purpose financial statements for much of the financial
information they need (primary users of general purpose financial statements).

 Information about a reporting entity’s economic
resources, claims against the entity and changes in
resources and claims
General purpose financial statements provide information about an entity’s
financial position, specifically about the entity’s economic resources and the
claims against the entity. Financial statements also provide information about
the effects of transactions and other events that change the entity’s economic
resources and claims. Users use this information to make decisions and form
expectations based on their assessment of the amount, timing and uncertainty
of the entity’s future cash flows.
Financial statements also show how efficiently and effectively the reporting
entity’s management has met its responsibility to use the entity’s economic
resources. This information helps users assess management’s stewardship of
those resources.
Qualitative characteristics of information in financial statements
An entity uses the qualitative characteristics of useful financial information
described in paragraphs 2.9–2.24 to identify the types of information likely to
be most useful for users when making decisions about the entity.
Financial information is useful only if it is relevant and faithfully represents
what it purports to represent. The usefulness of financial information is
enhanced if it is comparable, verifiable, timely and understandable.
Fundamental qualitative characteristics
The fundamental qualitative characteristics of financial information are
relevance and faithful representation.
Relevance
Financial information is relevant if it can influence users’ decisions.
Information might be relevant even if some users choose not to make use of it
or are already aware of it from other sources.
Financial information can affect users’ decisions by having predictive value,
confirmatory value or both.
Materiality
Information is material if omitting, misstating or obscuring it could
reasonably be expected to influence decisions that the primary users of
general purpose financial statements make on the basis of those financial
statements, which provide financial information about a specific reporting
entity. Materiality is an entity-specific aspect of relevance based on the nature
or magnitude, or both, of the items to which the information relates in the
context of the entity’s financial statements. Consequently, the IASB cannot
specify a uniform quantitative threshold for materiality or predetermine what
information might be material in a particular situation.

 Faithful representation
Financial statements represent economic phenomena in words and numbers.
Useful financial information not only represents relevant phenomena, but
also faithfully represents the substance of the phenomena that it purports to
represent. In many circumstances, the substance of an economic phenomenon
and its legal form are the same. If they are not the same, information about
the legal form would not, by itself, faithfully represent the economic
phenomenon.
To be a perfectly faithful representation, a depiction of an economic
phenomenon would have three characteristics: completeness, neutrality and
freedom from error. Perfection is rarely, if ever, achievable. Instead, the
IASB’s objective is to maximise those qualities to the extent possible.
To be complete, a depiction of an economic phenomenon includes all
information necessary for a user to understand the phenomenon, including all
necessary descriptions and explanations.
To be neutral, a depiction of an economic phenomenon is without bias in the
selection or presentation of financial information. Neutrality is supported by
prudence, which is the exercise of caution when an entity makes judgements
under conditions of uncertainty. The exercise of prudence means that assets
and income are not overstated and liabilities and expenses are not
understated. Equally, prudence does not allow for the understatement of
assets or income or the overstatement of liabilities or expenses. Such
misstatements can lead to the overstatement or understatement of income or
expenses in future periods. Consequently, some sections of this Standard
might contain asymmetric requirements if necessary to help an entity select
the most relevant information that faithfully represents what it purports to
represent.
Faithful representation does not mean the depiction of an economic
phenomenon is accurate in all respects. To be free from error, a depiction of
the phenomenon contains no errors or omissions, and an entity has selected
and applied, without errors, a process to produce the information in the
financial statements.
Applying the fundamental qualitative characteristics
The most efficient and effective process by which an entity applies the
fundamental qualitative characteristics of financial information, subject to
the effects of enhancing characteristics (see paragraph 2.20) and the cost
constraint (see paragraphs 2.25–2.27), is usually:
(a)
first, to identify an economic phenomenon, about which information
can be useful to users.
(b)
second, to identify the type of information about the phenomenon in
(a) that would be most relevant.
2.14
2.15

25
 (c)
third, to assess whether the relevant information in (b) is available and
whether it can provide a faithful representation of the economic
phenomenon. If so, the process of satisfying the fundamental
qualitative characteristics ends at that point. If not, the entity repeats
the process with the next most relevant type of information. In some
cases, the entity might have to prioritise one or more of the
fundamental qualitative characteristics over others to meet the
objective of financial statements (see paragraph 2.32).
Enhancing qualitative characteristics
Comparability, verifiability, timeliness and understandability are qualitative
characteristics that enhance the usefulness of relevant information that
provides a faithful representation of what it purports to represent. These
enhancing qualitative characteristics might also help an entity decide how it
depicts an economic phenomenon if the entity judges that more than one way
provides equally relevant information and an equally faithful representation
of that phenomenon.
Comparability
Information about an entity is more useful if users can compare that
information with similar information about other entities and with similar
information about the same entity for another period or another date.
Comparability is the qualitative characteristic that enables users to identify
and understand similarities in, and differences between, items. Comparability
is reduced if entities are permitted to use alternative accounting methods for
the same phenomenon.
Verifiability
Verifiability helps assure users that information faithfully represents the
phenomenon it purports to represent. Verifiability means that knowledgeable
and independent observers could reach consensus, although not necessarily
complete agreement, that a particular depiction is faithful. Quantified
information does not have to be a single point estimate to be verifiable; a
range of possible amounts and the related probabilities can also be verified.
Timeliness
Timeliness means having information available to decision-makers in time for
it to be able to influence their decisions. Generally, the older the information
is, the less useful it is. However, some information might continue to be
timely long after the end of a reporting period because, for example, some
users will use it to identify and analyse trends.
Understandability
Classifying, characterising and presenting information clearly and concisely
makes it understandable. However, understandability should not be used as a
justification for omitting material information. A set of financial statements
would be incomplete if an entity excluded information about phenomena
2.20
2.21
2.22
2.23
2.24
FEBRUARY 2025
26
© IFRS Foundation
 because the phenomena are inherently complex and cannot be made easy to
understand.
The cost constraint on useful financial reporting
Cost is a pervasive constraint on the information that an entity can provide.
Reporting financial information imposes costs on an entity, so it is important
that those costs are justified by the benefits of reporting that information.
Entities expend most of the effort involved in collecting, processing, verifying
and disseminating financial information, but users ultimately bear those costs
in the form of reduced returns. Users also incur costs of analysing and
interpreting the information an entity provides. If entities do not provide
needed information, users incur additional costs to obtain that information
elsewhere or to estimate it.
Reporting relevant financial information that faithfully represents what it
purports to represent helps users to make decisions confidently. Confident
decision-making results in more efficient functioning of capital markets and a
lower cost of capital for the economy as a whole. An individual user also
benefits by making more informed decisions. However, it is not possible for
financial statements to provide all the information that every user might find
relevant.
Undue cost or effort
Some requirements in this Standard are accompanied by an undue cost or
effort exemption. Such exemptions do not apply to other requirements in this
Standard.
Whether an entity must spend undue cost or effort to obtain or judge the
information necessary to comply with a requirement depends on the entity’s
specific circumstances and on management’s judgement of the costs and
benefits of applying that requirement. To make this judgement, an entity
considers how users’ decision-making could be affected by not having that
information. An entity would spend undue cost or effort applying a
requirement if the incremental cost (for example, valuers’ fees) or additional
effort (for example, endeavours by employees) substantially exceeds the
benefits users would receive from having the information. This Standard
usually requires an SME to judge undue cost or effort using a lower threshold
than other IFRS Accounting Standards require of publicly accountable entities
because SMEs are not accountable to public stakeholders.
An entity judges whether a requirement would involve undue cost or effort on
initial recognition in the financial statements—for example, at the date of the
transaction—based on information about the costs and benefits of the
requirement at the time of initial recognition. If the undue cost or effort
exemption also applies after initial recognition—for example, to a subsequent
measurement of an item—the entity makes a new judgement of undue cost or
effort at that subsequent date, based on information available at that date.

 If an entity applies an undue cost or effort exemption, the entity shall disclose
that fact and the reasons why applying the requirement would involve undue
cost or effort. This requirement does not apply to the undue cost or effort
exemption in paragraph 19.16, which is covered by the disclosure
requirements in paragraph 19.38.
Financial statements and the reporting entity
Objective and scope of financial statements
The objective of financial statements is to provide financial information about
the reporting entity’s assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses that is
useful to users to assess the prospects for the entity’s future net cash inflows
and management’s stewardship of the entity’s economic resources (see
paragraph 2.4).
Reporting period
An entity prepares its financial statements for a specified reporting period and
discloses information about:
(a)
its assets and liabilities—including unrecognised assets and liabilities
—and equity that existed at the end of or during the reporting period;
and
(b)
its income and expenses for the reporting period.
To help users identify and analyse changes and trends, an entity also discloses
in its financial statements comparative information for at least one preceding
reporting period, except if this Standard permits or requires otherwise.
An entity also discloses in its financial statements information about possible
future transactions and events if the information:
(a)
relates to the entity’s assets or liabilities—including unrecognised
assets or liabilities—or to equity that existed at the end of or during
the reporting period, or to income or expenses for the reporting
period; and
(b)
is useful to users.
An entity does not usually disclose in its financial statements other types of
forward-looking information—for example, explanatory material about
management’s expectations and strategies.
Perspective adopted in financial statements
An entity discloses in its financial statements information about transactions
and other events from the perspective of the entity as a whole, not that of any
particular group of the entity’s current or potential investors, lenders or other
creditors.

 Going concern assumption
An entity normally prepares its financial statements on the assumption that it
is a going concern and will continue in operation for the foreseeable future.
Users assume that the entity has neither the intention nor the need to enter
liquidation or to stop trading. If the entity has such an intention or need, it
might prepare the financial statements on another basis. If so, the entity
describes in its financial statements the basis it has used (see paragraphs
3.8–3.9).
The reporting entity
A reporting entity is an entity that is required, or chooses, to prepare financial
statements. A reporting entity is not necessarily a legal entity. A reporting
entity can be a single entity, a portion of an entity or more than one entity.
If a reporting entity comprises both a parent and its subsidiaries, the
reporting entity’s financial statements are referred to as consolidated
financial statements. If the reporting entity comprises two or more entities
that are not linked by a parent–subsidiary relationship, the reporting entity’s
financial statements are referred to as combined financial statements.
The boundary of the reporting entity is based on users’ information needs.
Users need relevant information that faithfully represents what it purports to
represent. Faithful representation requires that:
(a)
the boundary of the reporting entity does not contain an arbitrary or
incomplete set of economic activities;
(b)
including that set of economic activities within the boundary of the
reporting entity results in neutral information; and
(c)
a description is provided of how the boundary of the reporting entity
was determined and what constitutes the reporting entity.
The elements of financial statements
The elements of financial statements are:
(a)
assets, liabilities and equity, which relate to a reporting entity’s
financial position; and
(b)
income and expenses, which relate to a reporting entity’s financial
performance.
These elements are linked to the economic resources, claims and changes in
economic resources and claims discussed in paragraphs 2.6–2.7.
Definition of an asset
An asset is a present economic resource controlled by an entity as a result of
past events.

 An economic resource is a right that has the potential to produce economic
benefits. It does not have to be certain, or even likely, that the right will
produce economic benefits for the potential to exist; it is only necessary that
the right exists.
Rights that have the potential to produce economic benefits take many forms,
including:
(a)
rights that correspond to an obligation of another party, for example:
(i)
rights to receive cash.
(ii)
rights to receive goods or services.
(iii)
rights to exchange economic resources with another party on
favourable terms. Such rights include, for example, a forward
contract to buy an economic resource on terms that are
currently favourable or an option to buy an economic resource.
(iv)
rights to benefit from an obligation of another party to transfer
an economic resource if a specified uncertain future event
occurs.
(b)
rights that do not correspond to an obligation of another party—for
example, rights over physical assets, such as property, plant and
equipment or inventories, or rights over some intangible assets.
Many rights are established by contract, legislation or similar means. For
example, an entity might obtain rights from owning or leasing an object, from
owning a debt instrument or an equity instrument, or from owning a
registered patent. However, an entity might also obtain rights in other ways—
for example:
(a)
by acquiring or creating know-how not in the public domain; or
(b)
through another party’s obligation that arises because that other party
has no practical ability to act in a manner inconsistent with its
customary practices, published policies or specific statements.
An entity controls an economic resource if it has the present ability to direct
the use of the economic resource and obtain the economic benefits that might
flow from it. An entity has the present ability to direct the use of an economic
resource if it has the right to deploy that economic resource in its activities, or
to allow another party to deploy the economic resource in that party’s
activities. Control includes the present ability to prevent other parties from
directing the use of the economic resource and from obtaining the economic
benefits that may flow from it.
Definition of a liability
A liability is an entity’s present obligation to transfer an economic resource as
a result of past events.

© IFRS Foundation
 A liability exists only if:
(a)
an entity has an obligation;
(b)
the obligation is to transfer an economic resource; and
(c)
the obligation is a present obligation that exists as a result of past
events.
An entity has an obligation if it has a duty or responsibility that the entity has
no practical ability to avoid. An obligation is always owed to another party (or
parties). It is not necessary for the entity to know the identity of the party (or
parties) to whom the obligation is owed. Many obligations are established by
contract, legislation or similar means and are legally enforceable by the party
(or parties) to whom they are owed. However, obligations can also arise from
an entity’s customary practices, published policies or specific statements if the
entity has no practical ability to act in a manner inconsistent with those
practices, policies or statements. The obligation that arises in such situations
is sometimes referred to as a constructive obligation.
A liability gives rise to an obligation to transfer an economic resource if the
obligation has the potential to require an entity to transfer the economic
resource to another party (or parties). It does not have to be certain, or even
likely, that the entity will be required to transfer the economic resource for
that potential to exist. It is only necessary that the obligation exists and that,
in at least one circumstance, it would require the entity to transfer the
economic resource.
Obligations to transfer an economic resource include:
(a)
obligations to pay cash;
(b)
obligations to deliver goods or provide services;
(c)
obligations to exchange economic resources with another party on
unfavourable terms;
(d)
obligations to transfer an economic resource if a specified uncertain
future event occurs; and
(e)
obligations to issue a financial instrument if that financial instrument
obliges the entity to transfer an economic resource.
Instead of fulfilling an obligation to transfer an economic resource to the
party that has a right to receive that resource, an entity might sometimes
decide, for example:
(a)
to settle the obligation by negotiating a release from the obligation;
(b)
to transfer the obligation to a third party; or
(c)
to replace that obligation to transfer an economic resource with
another obligation by entering into a new transaction.

31
 A present obligation exists as a result of past events only if an entity:
(a)
has already obtained economic benefits or taken an action giving rise
to the obligation; and
(b)
will or might have to transfer an economic resource that it would not
otherwise have had to transfer.
The economic benefits the entity obtained could include, for example, goods
or services. The action the entity has taken could include, for example,
operating a particular business or operating in a particular market. If the
entity has obtained economic benefits, or has taken an action, over time, the
resulting present obligation might accumulate over that time.
Assets and liabilities
Unit of account
The unit of account is the right or the group of rights, the obligation or the
group of obligations, or the group of rights and obligations, to which an entity
applies recognition criteria and measurement concepts.
An entity selects a unit of account for an asset or liability when it considers
how recognition criteria and measurement concepts will apply to that asset or
liability and to the related income and expenses. In some circumstances, it
might be appropriate for the entity to select one unit of account for
recognition and another unit of account for measurement. For example, an
entity might sometimes recognise contracts individually, but measure them as
part of a portfolio of contracts. For presentation and disclosure, an entity
might aggregate or separate assets, liabilities, income and expenses into their
components.
Executory contracts
An executory contract is a contract, or a portion of a contract, that is equally
unperformed—neither party has fulfilled any of its obligations, or both parties
have partly fulfilled their obligations to an equal extent.
An executory contract establishes a combined right and obligation to
exchange economic resources. The right and obligation constitute a single
asset or liability. The entity has an asset if the terms of the exchange are
currently favourable; it has a liability if the terms of the exchange are
currently unfavourable. Whether the entity includes such an asset or liability
in its financial statements depends on both the recognition criteria and the
measurement basis the entity selected for the asset or liability, including, if
applicable, any test for whether the contract is onerous.
Definition of equity
Equity is the residual interest in an entity’s assets after deducting all its
liabilities.

 Definitions of income and expenses
Income is increases in assets, or decreases in liabilities, that result in increases
in equity, other than those relating to contributions from holders of equity
claims.
Expenses are decreases in assets, or increases in liabilities, that result in
decreases in equity other than those relating to distributions to holders of
equity claims.
Income and expenses are the elements of financial statements that relate to
an entity’s financial performance. Users need information about both an
entity’s financial position and its financial performance. Although income and
expenses are defined in terms of changes in assets and liabilities, information
about income and expenses is just as important as information about assets
and liabilities.
Transactions and other events generate income and expenses with varied
characteristics. Separating information about income and expenses that have
differing characteristics can help users understand the entity’s financial
performance.
Recognition and derecognition
The recognition process
Recognition is the process of capturing assets, liabilities, equity, income and
expenses in the statement of financial position or the statement(s) of
financial performance.3 Recognition involves depicting the item—either alone
or in aggregation with other items—in words and by a single monetary
amount in one of those statements and including that amount in one or more
totals in that statement. The carrying amount is the amount at which an
entity recognises an asset, a liability or equity in the statement of financial
position.
Recognition links the elements of financial statements, the statement of
financial position and the statement(s) of financial performance (see Figure
2.1). In the statement of financial position at the beginning and end of the
reporting period, total assets minus total liabilities equals total equity.
Recognised changes in equity during the reporting period comprise:
(a)
income minus expenses recognised in the statement(s) of financial
performance; plus
(b)
contributions from holders of equity claims minus distributions to
holders of equity claims.

The IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard does not specify whether the statement(s) of financial
performance comprise(s) a single statement or two statements. The term ‘statement of profit or
loss’ refers to both a separate statement and a separate section within a single statement of
financial performance.

Recognition criteria
Only items that meet the definition of an asset, a liability or equity are
recognised in the statement of financial position. Similarly, only items that
meet the definition of income or expenses are recognised in the statement(s)
of financial performance. However, not all items that meet the definition of
one of those elements are recognised.
An entity cannot correct its failure to recognise an item that satisfies the
recognition criteria by disclosing the accounting policies it used or by
providing notes or explanatory material.
Relevance
Information about assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses is relevant
to users. However, recognition of a particular asset or liability and any
resulting income, expenses or changes in equity might not always provide
relevant information. For example, if it is uncertain whether an asset or
liability exists, or if an asset or liability exists but the probability of an inflow
or outflow of economic benefits is low, information about that asset or
liability might not be relevant. However, that information could be relevant in
combination with other factors.
Existence uncertainty
In some cases, it might be unclear whether an asset or liability exists. That
uncertainty, which might coincide with a low probability of inflows or
outflows of economic benefits and an exceptionally wide range of possible
outcomes, might mean that recognising a single asset or liability would not
provide relevant information. Whether or not an entity has recognised the
asset or liability, the entity might need to provide explanatory information in
the financial statements about the associated uncertainties.

 Faithful representation
Recognition of a particular asset or liability is appropriate if it provides not
only relevant information, but also a faithful representation of that asset or
liability and of any resulting income, expenses or changes in equity. Whether
an entity can provide a faithful representation might be affected by the level
of measurement uncertainty associated with the asset or liability or by other
factors.
Measurement uncertainty
An entity measures an asset or liability in order to recognise it. In many cases,
an entity estimates this measurement and it is therefore subject to
measurement uncertainty. Using estimates is an essential part of preparing
financial information and does not undermine the usefulness of the
information if an entity clearly and accurately describes and explains the
estimates.
An item that fails to meet the recognition criteria might later qualify for
recognition as a result of circumstances or events.
Whether or not an entity recognises an asset or liability, the entity might need
to include explanatory information to provide a faithful representation of the
asset or liability. The entity could include information about the uncertainties
associated with the asset or liability’s existence or measurement, or with its
outcome—the amount or timing of any inflow or outflow of economic
benefits that will ultimately result from the asset or liability (see paragraphs
2.108–2.109).
Derecognition
Derecognition is the removal of all or part of a recognised asset or liability
from an entity’s statement of financial position. Derecognition normally
occurs if that item no longer meets the definition of an asset or a liability. For
example:
(a)
for an asset, derecognition normally occurs if the entity loses control
of all or part of the recognised asset; and
(b)
for a liability, derecognition normally occurs if the entity no longer has
a present obligation for all or part of the recognised liability.
Accounting requirements for derecognition in this Standard aim for an entity
to faithfully represent any assets and liabilities it retained after a transaction
or other event that led to derecognition and the change in the entity’s assets
or liabilities as a result of that transaction or other event.
To achieve the aim described in paragraph 2.77, an entity normally:
(a)
derecognises any of its assets or liabilities that have expired or have
been consumed, collected, fulfilled or transferred, and recognises any
resulting income and expenses; and
(b)
continues to recognise any of its retained assets or liabilities.

 To achieve the aim described in paragraph 2.77, an entity can:
(a)
present the retained component separately in the statement of
financial position;
(b)
present separately in the statement(s) of financial performance any
income and expenses the entity recognised as a result of the
derecognition of the transferred component; or
(c)
provide explanatory information.
Measurement
An entity quantifies elements recognised in financial statements in monetary
terms. To quantify an element, an entity first selects a measurement basis.
A measurement basis is an identified feature—for example, historical cost,
fair value or fulfilment value—of the item being measured. Applying a
measurement basis to an asset or liability creates a measure for that asset or
liability and for related income and expenses.
The appropriate measurement basis is specific to the item being measured.
Measurement bases
Historical cost
Historical cost measures provide monetary information about assets, liabilities
and related income and expenses using information an entity derived, at least
in part, from the price of the transaction or other event that gave rise to them.
The historical cost of an asset is the value of the costs incurred in acquiring or
creating the asset, comprising the consideration an entity paid to acquire or
create the asset plus transaction costs. The historical cost of a liability is the
value of the consideration the entity received to incur or take on the liability
minus transaction costs.
An entity updates over time the historical cost of an asset to depict, if
applicable:
(a)
the consumption of part or all of the economic resource that
constitutes the asset (depreciation or amortisation);
(b)
any payments received for part or all of the asset;
(c)
the effect of events that cause part or all of the historical cost of the
asset to no longer be recoverable (impairment); and
(d)
the accrual of interest to reflect any financing component of the asset.
An entity updates over time the historical cost of a liability to depict, if
applicable:
(a)
the fulfilment of part or all of the liability—for example, by making
payments that diminish part or all of the liability or by satisfying an
obligation to deliver goods or services.

 (b)
the effect of events that increase the value of the obligation to transfer
the economic resources needed to fulfil the liability to the extent that
the liability becomes onerous. A liability is onerous if the historical
cost is no longer enough to depict the obligation to fulfil the liability.
(c)
the accrual of interest to reflect any financing component of the
liability.
One way an entity applies a historical cost measurement basis to financial
assets and financial liabilities is to measure them at amortised cost. The
amortised cost of a financial asset or financial liability reflects estimates of
future cash flows discounted at the rate the entity determined at initial
recognition. For variable rate instruments, the entity updates the discount
rate to reflect changes in the variable rate. Over time, the entity updates the
amortised cost of a financial asset or financial liability to depict changes such
as the accrual of interest, the impairment of a financial asset and receipts or
payments.
Current value
Measurements based on current value provide monetary information about
assets, liabilities and related income and expenses using information updated
to reflect conditions at the measurement date. Current value measurement
bases include:
(a)
fair value;
(b)
current cost;
(c)
value in use for assets; and
(d)
fulfilment value for liabilities.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to
transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at
the measurement date. Because fair value is not derived, even in part, from
the price of the transaction or other event that gives rise to the asset or the
liability, fair value is not increased by transaction costs an entity incurs when
acquiring the asset and is not decreased by the transaction costs an entity
incurs when it takes on the liability.
Current cost is the cost of an equivalent asset at the measurement date,
comprising the consideration an entity would pay at the measurement date
plus the transaction costs the entity would incur at that date. The current cost
of a liability is the consideration an entity would receive for an equivalent
liability at the measurement date minus the transaction costs the entity
would incur at that date.
Value in use is the present value of the cash flows or other economic benefits
that an entity expects to derive from the use of an asset and from its ultimate
disposal. Fulfilment value is the present value of the cash or other economic
resources that an entity expects to be obliged to transfer when it fulfils a
liability. Because value in use and fulfilment value are based on future cash
2.87
2.88

2.90
2.91

© IFRS Foundation
37
 flows, they do not include transaction costs incurred when an entity acquires
an asset or takes on a liability.
Information provided by particular measurement bases
When an entity selects a measurement basis, it considers the nature of the
information that the measurement basis will produce in both the statement of
financial position and the statement(s) of financial performance.
Historical cost
If an entity measures an asset or liability at historical cost, the resulting
information might be relevant to users because historical cost uses
information derived, at least in part, from the price of the transaction or other
event that gave rise to the asset or liability. Because an entity reduces
historical cost to reflect consumption of an asset and its impairment, the
amount expected to be recovered from an asset measured at historical cost is
at least as great as its carrying amount. Similarly, because an entity increases
the historical cost of a liability when the liability becomes onerous, the value
of the obligation to transfer the economic resources needed to fulfil the
liability is no more than the carrying amount of the liability.
Current value
If an entity measures an asset or liability at fair value, the resulting
information might have predictive value because fair value reflects market
participants’ current expectations about the amount, timing and uncertainty
of future cash flows.
If an entity measures an asset using value in use, the resulting information is
about the present value of the estimated cash flows from the use of the asset
and from its ultimate disposal. This information might have predictive value
because it can be used in assessing the prospects for future net cash inflows.
If an entity measures a liability using fulfilment value, the resulting
information is about the present value of the estimated cash flows needed to
fulfil the liability. This information might have predictive value, particularly
if the entity expects to fulfil the liability instead of transferring it or settling it
by negotiation.
If an entity provides updated estimates of value in use or fulfilment value,
combined with information about estimates of the amount, timing and
uncertainty of future cash flows, that information might help verify previous
estimates of value in use or fulfilment value.
If an entity measures an asset or liability using current cost, the resulting
information might be relevant because current cost reflects the cost at which
an equivalent asset could be acquired or created at the measurement date or
the consideration that would be received from incurring or taking on an
equivalent liability.

 Factors to consider when selecting a measurement basis
When an entity selects a measurement basis for an asset or liability and for
the related income and expenses, the entity considers the nature of the
information that the measurement basis will produce in both the statement of
financial position and the statement(s) of financial performance.
In most cases, an entity will not select a measurement basis based on a single
factor. The relative importance of each factor depends on the facts and
circumstances of the item being measured.
An entity selects a measurement basis that will provide useful information to
users. To be useful, the information is relevant and faithfully represents what
it purports to represent. In addition, the information should be comparable,
verifiable, timely and understandable, to the extent possible.
Relevance
The relevance of information an entity provides using a measurement basis is
affected by:
(a)
the characteristics of the asset or liability, in particular the variability
of cash flows and whether the value of the asset or liability is sensitive
to market factors or other risks; and
(b)
how that asset or liability contributes to future cash flows.
If the value of an asset or liability is sensitive to market factors or other risks,
its historical cost might differ significantly from its current value.
Consequently, historical cost might not provide relevant information if
information about changes in value is important to users.
For assets and liabilities that produce cash flows directly, such as assets that
can be sold independently and without a substantial economic penalty (for
example, without substantial business disruption), the measurement basis
that provides the most relevant information is likely a current value that
takes into account current estimates of the amount, timing and uncertainty of
the future cash flows. For assets and liabilities that do not produce cash flows
directly, an entity considers the principles of relevance and faithful
representation to the extent that they apply to the facts and circumstances.
If an entity’s business activity involves managing financial assets and financial
liabilities with the objective of collecting contractual cash flows, amortised
cost might provide relevant information that can be used to derive the margin
between the interest earned on the assets and the interest incurred on the
liabilities.
Faithful representation
In some circumstances, an entity uses the same measurement basis for related
assets and liabilities to provide users with more useful information than the
information that would result from using different measurement bases—for
example, if the entity’s cash flows from one asset or liability are directly
linked to its cash flows from another asset or liability.

 As noted in paragraph 2.18, although a perfectly faithful representation is free
from error, measures do not have to be perfectly accurate.
Measurement uncertainty arises if an entity estimates an item’s value because
it cannot measure the item by observing prices in an active market. The level
of measurement uncertainty associated with a particular measurement basis
might affect whether the information an entity provides using that
measurement basis is a faithful representation of the entity’s financial
position and financial performance. A high level of measurement uncertainty
does not necessarily prevent an entity from using a measurement basis that
provides relevant information, but in some cases, the level is so high that such
information might not lead to a sufficiently faithful representation. In these
cases, an entity should consider selecting another measurement basis that
would also result in relevant information.
Measurement uncertainty is not the same as outcome uncertainty and
existence uncertainty. Outcome uncertainty arises when there is uncertainty
about the amount or timing of any inflow or outflow of economic benefits
that will result from an asset or liability. Existence uncertainty arises when an
asset or a liability’s existence is uncertain. Paragraphs 2.70–2.71 discuss how
existence uncertainty might affect an entity’s decisions to recognise an asset
or liability when the entity is uncertain about whether that asset or liability
exists.
Enhancing qualitative characteristics and the cost constraint
The enhancing qualitative characteristics of comparability, understandability
and verifiability, and the cost constraint, affect an entity’s selection of a
measurement basis. The enhancing qualitative characteristic of timeliness has
no specific implications for measurement.
Consistently using the same measurement bases for the same items, either
from period to period within a reporting entity or in a single period across
entities, can help make financial statements more comparable.
If an entity changes the measurement basis it uses, its financial statements
might be less understandable. However, a change might be justified if, for
example, the change results in more relevant information. If an entity
changes the measurement basis it uses, users might need explanatory
information to understand the effect of that change.
Understandability depends partly on how many measurement bases an entity
uses and whether its use of those bases changes over time. In general, the
more measurement bases an entity uses, the more complex the resulting
information. Consequently, the information becomes less understandable and
the totals or subtotals in the statement of financial position and the
statement(s) of financial performance become less informative. However, it
could be appropriate for an entity to use more measurement bases if doing so
provides useful information.

 Verifiability is improved when an entity uses measurement bases that result
in information that can be independently corroborated, either directly (for
example, by observing prices) or indirectly (for example, by checking inputs to
a model). If a measure cannot be verified, an entity might provide explanatory
information to enable users to understand how the entity determined the
measure.
Measurement of equity
An entity does not directly measure the total carrying amount of equity (total
equity). The total of the carrying amounts of all recognised assets minus the
total of the carrying amounts of all recognised liabilities equals the total
equity.
Although an entity does not directly measure total equity, the entity might
directly measure the carrying amount of some individual classes of equity and
some components of equity.
Presentation and disclosure
Presentation and disclosure as communication tools
A reporting entity communicates information about its assets, liabilities,
equity, income and expenses by presenting and disclosing information in its
financial statements.
An entity that effectively presents and discloses information in its financial
statements makes that information more relevant, understandable and
comparable. Effective presentation and disclosure also contribute to faithful
representation of the entity’s assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses.
Just as cost constrains other financial reporting decisions, it also constrains an
entity’s decisions about presentation and disclosure. When an entity decides
how to present and disclose information, it is important that the entity
considers whether the benefits to users justify the costs of providing and using
that information.
Classification
Classification is the sorting of assets, liabilities, equity, income or expenses on
the basis of shared characteristics for presentation and disclosure purposes.
Such characteristics include the nature of the item, its role (or function)
within the entity’s business activities and how the entity measures it.
Classifying dissimilar assets, liabilities, equity, income or expenses together
can obscure relevant information, reduce understandability and comparability
and might not result in a faithful representation of what the information
purports to represent.

 An entity applies the classification to the unit of account the entity selected
for an asset or liability. However, an entity separates an asset or liability’s
components by characteristic and classifies those components separately if the
resulting financial information is more useful.
An entity classifies income and expenses and includes them either:
(a)
in the statement of profit or loss; or
(b)
in other comprehensive income.
The statement of profit or loss is the primary source of information about an
entity’s financial performance for the reporting period. Therefore, in
principle, an entity includes all income and expenses in that statement. An
entity presents items of income or expense in other comprehensive income
only if explicitly permitted or required by this Standard.
In principle, an entity reclassifies income and expenses it included in other
comprehensive income in one period into the statement of profit or loss in a
future period if doing so results in the statement of profit or loss providing
more relevant information or providing a more faithful representation of the
entity’s financial performance, for that future period. Individual sections of
this Standard might describe situations in which an entity is permitted or
required to reclassify income and expenses included in other comprehensive
income.
Offsetting
Offsetting occurs when an entity recognises and measures both an asset and a
liability as separate units of account, but groups them into a single net
amount in the statement of financial position. Offsetting classifies dissimilar
items together and therefore is generally not appropriate unless required or
permitted by a specific section of this Standard.
Classification of equity
To provide useful information, an entity might classify equity claims
separately if those equity claims have differing characteristics.
Similarly, to provide useful information, an entity might classify components
of equity separately if some of those components are subject to particular
legal, regulatory or other requirements. For example, in some jurisdictions, an
entity is permitted to make distributions to holders of equity claims only if it
has enough reserves specified as distributable. Separate presentation or
disclosure of those reserves might provide useful information.
Aggregation
Aggregation is the adding together of assets, liabilities, equity, income or
expenses that have shared characteristics and are included in the same
classification.

 Aggregation can make information more useful by summarising a large
volume of detail, but in doing so, aggregation also conceals some of that
detail. An entity balances its use of aggregation so that relevant information is
not obscured either by too little or too much detail.

 Section 3
Financial Statement Presentation
Scope of this section
This section explains fair presentation of financial statements, what
compliance with the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard requires and what
comprises a complete set of financial statements.
Fair presentation
Financial statements shall present fairly the financial position, financial
performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the
faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events and
conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for
assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in Section 2 Concepts and
Pervasive Principles:
(a)
the application of the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard, with
additional disclosure when necessary, is presumed to result in
financial statements that achieve a fair presentation of the financial
position, financial performance and cash flows of SMEs.
(b)
the application of this Standard by an entity with public
accountability does not result in a fair presentation in accordance
with this Standard (see paragraph 1.5).
The additional disclosures referred to in (a) are necessary when compliance
with the specific requirements in this Standard is insufficient to enable users
to understand the effect of particular transactions, other events and
conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial performance.
Compliance with the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard
An entity whose financial statements comply with the IFRS for SMEs
Accounting Standard shall make an explicit and unreserved statement of such
compliance in the notes. Financial statements shall not be described as
complying with the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard unless they comply
with all the requirements of this Standard.
In the extremely rare circumstances when management concludes that
compliance with this Standard would be so misleading that it would conflict
with the objective of financial statements of SMEs set out in Section 2, the
entity shall depart from that requirement in the manner set out in
paragraph 3.5 unless the relevant regulatory framework prohibits such a
departure.
3.1
3.2
3.3
3.4
FEBRUARY 2025
44
© IFRS Foundation
 When an entity departs from a requirement of this Standard in accordance
with paragraph 3.4, it shall disclose the following:
(a)
that management has concluded that the financial statements present
fairly the entity’s financial position, financial performance and cash
flows;
(b)
that it has complied with the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard,
except that it has departed from a particular requirement to achieve a
fair presentation; and
(c)
the nature of the departure, including the treatment that the IFRS for
SMEs Accounting Standard would require, the reason why that
treatment would be so misleading in the circumstances that it would
conflict with the objective of financial statements set out in Section 2
and the treatment adopted.
When an entity has departed from a requirement of this Standard in a prior
period, and that departure affects the amounts recognised in the financial
statements for the current period, it shall make the disclosures set out in
paragraph 3.5(c).
In the extremely rare circumstances when management concludes that
compliance with a requirement in this Standard would be so misleading that
it would conflict with the objective of financial statements of SMEs set out in
Section 2, but the relevant regulatory framework prohibits departure from the
requirement, the entity shall, to the maximum extent possible, reduce the
perceived misleading aspects of compliance by disclosing the following:
(a)
the nature of the requirement in this Standard and the reason why
management has concluded that complying with that requirement is
so misleading in the circumstances that it conflicts with the objective
of financial statements set out in Section 2; and
(b)
for each period presented, the adjustments to each item in the
financial statements that management has concluded would be
necessary to achieve a fair presentation.
Going concern
When preparing financial statements, the management of an entity using this
Standard shall make an assessment of the entity’s ability to continue as a
going concern. An entity is a going concern unless management either
intends to liquidate the entity or to cease operations, or has no realistic
alternative but to do so. In assessing whether the going concern assumption is
appropriate, management takes into account all available information about
the future, which is at least, but is not limited to, twelve months from the
reporting date.
When management is aware, in making its assessment, of material
uncertainties related to events or conditions that cast significant doubt upon
the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, the entity shall disclose
those uncertainties. When an entity does not prepare financial statements on
3.5
3.6
3.7
3.8
3.9
IFRS FOR SMES ACCOUNTING STANDARD
© IFRS Foundation
45
 a going concern basis, it shall disclose that fact, together with the basis on
which it prepared the financial statements and the reason why the entity is
not regarded as a going concern.
Frequency of reporting
An entity shall present a complete set of financial statements (including
comparative information–see paragraph 3.14) at least annually. When the end
of an entity’s reporting period changes and the financial statements are
presented for a period longer or shorter than one year, the entity shall disclose
the following:
(a)
that fact;
(b)
the reason for using a longer or shorter period; and
(c)
the fact that comparative amounts presented in the financial
statements (including the related notes) are not entirely comparable.
Consistency of presentation
An entity shall retain the presentation and classification of items in the
financial statements from one period to the next unless:
(a)
it is apparent, following a significant change in the nature of the
entity’s operations or a review of its financial statements, that another
presentation or classification would be more appropriate having regard
to the criteria for the selection and application of accounting policies
in Section 10 Accounting Policies, Estimates and Errors; or
(b)
this Standard requires a change in presentation.
When the presentation or classification of items in the financial statements is
changed, an entity shall reclassify comparative amounts unless the
reclassification is impracticable. When comparative amounts are reclassified,
an entity shall disclose the following:
(a)
the nature of the reclassification;
(b)
the amount of each item or class of items that is reclassified; and
(c)
the reason for the reclassification.
If it is impracticable to reclassify comparative amounts, an entity shall
disclose why reclassification was not practicable.
Comparative information
Except when this Standard permits or requires otherwise, an entity shall
disclose comparative information in respect of the previous comparable period
for all amounts presented in the current period’s financial statements. An
entity shall include comparative information for narrative and descriptive
information when it is relevant to an understanding of the current period’s
financial statements.

 Materiality and aggregation
An entity shall present separately each material class of similar items. An
entity shall present separately items of a dissimilar nature or function unless
they are immaterial.
When applying this Standard an entity shall decide, after taking into
consideration all the relevant facts and circumstances, how it aggregates
information in the financial statements, including the notes. An entity shall
not reduce the understandability of its financial statements by obscuring
material information with immaterial information or by aggregating material
items that have different natures or functions.
Information is material if omitting, misstating or obscuring it could
reasonably be expected to influence decisions that the primary users of
general purpose financial statements make on the basis of those financial
statements, which provide financial information about a specific reporting
entity. Materiality depends on the nature or magnitude of information, or
both. An entity assesses whether information, either individually or in
combination with other information, is material in the context of its financial
statements taken as a whole.
Accrual basis
An entity shall prepare its financial statements, except for cash flow
information, using the accrual basis of accounting. On the accrual basis, items
are recognised as assets, liabilities, equity, income or expenses when they
satisfy the definitions and recognition criteria for those items.
Complete set of financial statements
A complete set of financial statements of an entity shall include all of the
following:
(a)
a statement of financial position as at the reporting date;
(b)
either:
(i)
a single statement of comprehensive income for the reporting
period displaying all items of income and expense recognised
during the period including those items recognised in
determining profit or loss (which is a subtotal in the statement
of comprehensive income) and items of other comprehensive
income.
(ii)
a separate income statement and a separate statement of
comprehensive income. If the entity chooses to present both an
income statement and a statement of comprehensive income,
the statement of comprehensive income begins with profit or
loss and then displays the items of other comprehensive
income.
(c)
a statement of changes in equity for the reporting period;
3.15
3.15A
3.16
3.16A
3.17
IFRS FOR SMES ACCOUNTING STANDARD
© IFRS Foundation
47
 (d)
a statement of cash flows for the reporting period; and
(e)
notes, comprising material accounting policy information and other
explanatory information.
If the only changes to equity during the periods for which financial
statements are presented arise from profit or loss, payment of dividends,
corrections of prior period errors, and changes in accounting policy, the
entity may present a single statement of income and retained earnings in
place of the statement of comprehensive income and statement of changes in
equity (see paragraph 6.4).
If an entity has no items of other comprehensive income in any of the periods
for which financial statements are presented, it may present only an income
statement or it may present a statement of comprehensive income in which
the ‘bottom line’ is labelled ‘profit or loss’.
Because paragraph 3.14 requires comparative amounts in respect of the
previous period for all amounts presented in the financial statements, a
complete set of financial statements means that an entity shall present, as a
minimum, two of each of the required financial statements and related notes.
In a complete set of financial statements, an entity shall present each financial
statement with equal prominence.
An entity may use titles for the financial statements other than those used in
this Standard as long as they are not misleading.
Identification of the financial statements
An entity shall clearly identify each of the financial statements and the notes
and distinguish them from other information in the same document. In
addition, an entity shall display the following information prominently and
repeat it when necessary for an understanding of the information presented:
(a)
the name of the reporting entity and any change in its name since the

 Section 4
Statement of Financial Position
Scope of this section
This section sets out the information that is to be presented in a statement of
financial position and how to present it. The statement of financial position
(sometimes called the balance sheet) presents an entity’s assets, liabilities and
equity as of a specific date—the end of the reporting period.
Information to be presented in the statement of financial position
The statement of financial position shall include line items that present the
following amounts:
(a)
cash and cash equivalents;
(b)
trade and other receivables;
(c)
financial assets (excluding amounts shown under (a), (b), (j) and (k));
(d)
inventories;
(e)
property, plant and equipment (including bearer plants in the scope
of Section 17 Property, Plant and Equipment);
(ea)
investment property carried at cost less accumulated depreciation
and impairment;
(f)
investment property carried at fair value through profit or loss;
(g)
intangible assets;
(h)
biological assets in the scope of Section 34 Specialised Activities carried
at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment;
(i)
biological assets in the scope of Section 34 carried at fair value through
profit or loss;
(j)
investments in associates;
(k)
investments in jointly controlled entities;
(l)
trade and other payables;
(m)
financial liabilities (excluding amounts shown under (l) and (p));
(n)
liabilities and assets for current tax;
(o)
deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets (these shall always be
classified as non-current);
(p)
provisions;
(q)
non-controlling interest, presented within equity separately from the
equity attributable to the owners of the parent; and
(r)
equity attributable to the owners of the parent.
4.1
4.2

© IFRS Foundation
 An entity shall present additional line items (including by disaggregating the
line items listed in paragraph 4.2), headings and subtotals in the statement of
financial position when such presentation is relevant to an understanding of
the entity’s financial position.
Current/non-current distinction
An entity shall present current and non-current assets, and current and
non-current liabilities, as separate classifications in its statement of financial
position in accordance with paragraphs 4.5–4.8, except when a presentation
based on liquidity provides information that is reliable and more relevant.
When that exception applies, all assets and liabilities shall be presented in
order of approximate liquidity (ascending or descending).
Current assets
An entity shall classify an asset as current when:
(a)
it expects to realise the asset, or intends to sell or consume it, in the
entity’s normal operating cycle;
(b)
it holds the asset primarily for the purpose of trading;
(c)
it expects to realise the asset within twelve months after the reporting
date; or
(d)
the asset is cash or a cash equivalent, unless it is restricted from being
exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after
the reporting date.
An entity shall classify all other assets as non-current. When the entity’s
normal operating cycle is not clearly identifiable, its duration is assumed to be
twelve months.
Current liabilities
An entity shall classify a liability as current when:
(a)
it expects to settle the liability in the entity’s normal operating cycle;
(b)
it holds the liability primarily for the purpose of trading;
(c)
the liability is due to be settled within twelve months after the
reporting date; or
(d)
the entity does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of
the liability for at least twelve months after reporting date.
An entity shall classify all other liabilities as non-current.

 Sequencing of items and format of items in the statement of
financial position
This Standard does not prescribe the sequence or format in which items are to
be presented. Paragraph 4.2 simply provides a list of items that are sufficiently
different in nature or function to warrant separate presentation in the
statement of financial position. In addition:
(a)
line items are included when the size, nature or function of an item or
aggregation of similar items is such that separate presentation is
relevant to an understanding of the entity’s financial position; and
(b)
the descriptions used and the sequencing of items or aggregation of
similar items may be amended according to the nature of the entity
and its transactions, to provide information that is relevant to an
understanding of the entity’s financial position.
The judgement on whether additional items are presented separately is based
on an assessment of all of the following:
(a)
the amounts, nature and liquidity of assets;
(b)
the function of assets within the entity; and
(c)
the amounts, nature and timing of liabilities.
Information to be presented either in the statement of financial
position or in the notes
An entity shall disclose, either in the statement of financial position or in the
notes, the following subclassifications of the line items presented:
(a)
property, plant and equipment in classifications appropriate to the
entity;
(b)
trade and other receivables showing separately amounts receivable
from related parties and receivable from other parties;
(c)
inventories, showing separately amounts of inventories:
(i)
held for sale in the ordinary course of business;
(ii)
in the process of production for such sale; and
(iii)
in the form of materials or supplies to be consumed in the
production process or in the rendering of services.
(d)
trade and other payables, showing separately amounts payable to trade
suppliers, payable to related parties, deferred income and accruals;
(e)
provisions for employee benefits and other provisions; and
(f)
classes of equity, such as paid-in capital, share premium, retained
earnings and items of income and expense that, as permitted or
required by this Standard, are recognised in other comprehensive
income and presented separately in equity.

 An entity with share capital shall disclose the following, either in the
statement of financial position or in the notes:
(a)
for each class of share capital:
(i)
the number of shares authorised.
(ii)
the number of shares issued and fully paid, and issued but not
fully paid.
(iii)
par value per share or that the shares have no par value.
(iv)
a reconciliation of the number of shares outstanding at the
beginning and at the end of the period. This reconciliation need
not be presented for prior periods.
(v)
the rights, preferences and restrictions attaching to that class
including restrictions on the distribution of dividends and the
repayment of capital.
(vi)
shares in the entity held by the entity or by its subsidiaries or
associates.
(vii)
shares reserved for issue under options and contracts for the
sale of shares, including the terms and amounts.
(b)
a description of each reserve within equity.
An entity without share capital, such as a partnership or trust, shall disclose
information equivalent to that required by paragraph 4.12(a), showing
changes during the period in each category of equity, and the rights,
preferences and restrictions attaching to each category of equity.
If, at the reporting date, an entity has a binding sale agreement for a major
disposal of assets, or a group of assets and liabilities, the entity shall disclose
the following information:
(a)
a description of the asset(s) or the group of assets and liabilities;
(b)
a description of the facts and circumstances of the sale; and
(c)
the carrying amount of the assets or, if the disposal involves a group
of assets and liabilities, the carrying amounts of those assets and
liabilities.

 Section 5
Statement of Comprehensive Income and Income Statement
Scope of this section
This section requires an entity to present its total comprehensive income for
a period—ie its financial performance for the period—in one or two financial
statements. It sets out the information that is to be presented in those
statements and how to present it.
Presentation of total comprehensive income
An entity shall present its total comprehensive income for a period either:
(a)
in a single statement of comprehensive income, in which case the
statement of comprehensive income presents all items of income and
expense recognised in the period; or
(b)
in two statements—an income statement and a statement of
comprehensive income—in which case the income statement presents
all items of income and expense recognised in the period except those
that are recognised in total comprehensive income outside of profit or
loss as permitted or required by this Standard.
A change from the single-statement approach to the two-statement approach,
or vice versa, is a change in accounting policy to which Section 10 Accounting
Policies, Estimates and Errors applies.
Single-statement approach
Under the single-statement approach, the statement of comprehensive income
shall include all items of income and expense recognised in a period unless
this Standard requires otherwise. This Standard provides different treatment
for the following circumstances:
(a)
the effects of corrections of errors and changes in accounting policies
are presented as retrospective adjustments of prior periods instead of
as part of profit or loss in the period in which they are identified (see
Section 10); and
(b)
four types of other comprehensive income are recognised as part of
total comprehensive income, outside of profit or loss, when they arise:
(i)
some gains and losses arising on translating the financial
statements of a foreign operation (see Section 30 Foreign
Currency Translation);
(ii)
some actuarial gains and losses (see Section 28 Employee Benefits);
(iii)
some changes in fair values of hedging instruments (see Part II
of Section 11 Financial Instruments); and
5.1
5.2
5.3

FEBRUARY 2025
54
© IFRS Foundation
 (iv)
changes in the revaluation surplus for property, plant and
equipment measured in accordance with the revaluation model
(see Section 17 Property, Plant and Equipment).
As a minimum, an entity shall include, in the statement of comprehensive
income, line items that present the following amounts for the period:
(a)
revenue.
(b)
finance costs.
(c)
share of the profit or loss of investments in associates (see Section 14
Investments in Associates) and jointly controlled entities (see Section 15
Joint Arrangements) accounted for using the equity method.
(d)
tax expense excluding tax allocated to items (e), (g) and (h) (see
paragraph 29.35).
(e)
a single amount comprising the total of:
(i)
the post-tax profit or loss of a discontinued operation; and
(ii)
the post-tax gain or loss attributable to an impairment, or
reversal of an impairment, of the assets in the discontinued
operation (see Section 27 Impairment of Assets), both at the time
and subsequent to being classified as a discontinued operation
and to the disposal of the net assets constituting the
discontinued operation.
(f)
profit or loss (if an entity has no items of other comprehensive income,
this line need not be presented).
(g)
each item of other comprehensive income (see paragraph 5.4(b))
classified by nature (excluding amounts in (h)). Such items shall be
grouped into those that, in accordance with this Standard:
(i)
will not be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss—ie those
in paragraph 5.4(b)(i)–(ii) and (iv); and
(ii)
will be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss when specific
conditions are met—ie those in paragraph 5.4(b)(iii).
(h)
share of the other comprehensive income of associates and jointly
controlled entities accounted for using the equity method.
(i)
total comprehensive income (if an entity has no items of other
comprehensive income, it may use another term for this line such as
profit or loss).
An entity shall disclose separately the following items in the statement of
comprehensive income as allocations for the period:
(a)
profit or loss for the period attributable to
(i)
non-controlling interest; and
(ii)
owners of the parent.
5.5
5.6
IFRS FOR SMES ACCOUNTING STANDARD
© IFRS Foundation
55
 (b)
total comprehensive income for the period attributable to
(i)
non-controlling interest; and
(ii)
owners of the parent.
Two-statement approach
Under the two-statement approach, the income statement shall display, as a
minimum, line items that present the amounts in paragraph 5.5(a)–5.5(f) for
the period, with profit or loss as the last line. The statement of comprehensive
income shall begin with profit or loss as its first line and shall display, as a
minimum, line items that present the amounts in paragraph 5.5(g)–5.5(i) and
paragraph 5.6 for the period.
Requirements applicable to both approaches
Under this Standard, the effects of corrections of errors and changes in
accounting policies are presented as retrospective adjustments of prior periods
instead of as part of profit or loss in the period in which they are identified
(see Section 10).
An entity shall present additional line items, headings and subtotals in the
statement of comprehensive income (and in the income statement, if
presented), when such presentation is relevant to an understanding of the
entity’s financial performance.
An entity shall not present or describe any items of income and expense as
‘extraordinary items’ in the statement of comprehensive income (or in the
income statement, if presented) or in the notes.
Analysis of expenses
An entity shall present an analysis of expenses using a classification based on
either the nature of expenses or the function of expenses within the entity,
whichever provides information that is reliable and more relevant.
Analysis by nature of expense
(a)
Under this method of classification, expenses are aggregated in the
statement of comprehensive income according to their nature (for
example, depreciation, purchases of materials, transport costs,
employee benefits and advertising costs) and are not reallocated
among various functions within the entity.
Analysis by function of expense
(b)
Under this method of classification, expenses are aggregated according
to their function as part of cost of sales or, for example, the costs of
distribution or administrative activities. At a minimum, an entity
discloses its cost of sales under this method separately from other
expenses.

 Section 6
Statement of Changes in Equity and Statement of Income and
Retained Earnings
Scope of this section
This section sets out requirements for presenting the changes in an entity’s
equity for a period, either in a statement of changes in equity or, if specified
conditions are met and an entity chooses, in a statement of income and
retained earnings.
Statement of changes in equity
Purpose
The statement of changes in equity presents an entity’s profit or loss for a
reporting period, other comprehensive income for the period, the effects of
changes in accounting policies and corrections of errors recognised in the
period and the amounts of investments by, and dividends and other
distributions to, owners in their capacity as owners during the period.
Information to be presented in the statement of changes
in equity
The statement of changes in equity includes the following information:
(a)
total comprehensive income for the period, showing separately the
total amounts attributable to owners of the parent and to
non-controlling interests;
(b)
for each component of equity, the effects of retrospective application
or retrospective restatement recognised in accordance with Section 10
Accounting Policies, Estimates and Errors; and
(c)
for each component of equity, a reconciliation between the carrying
amount at the beginning and the end of the period, separately
disclosing changes resulting from:
(i)
profit or loss;
(ii)
other comprehensive income; and
(iii)
the amounts of investments by, and dividends and other
distributions to, owners in their capacity as owners, showing
separately issues of shares, treasury share transactions,
dividends and other distributions to owners and changes in
ownership interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a loss
of control.

 Statement of income and retained earnings
Purpose
The statement of income and retained earnings presents an entity’s profit or
loss and changes in retained earnings for a reporting period. Paragraph 3.18
permits an entity to present a statement of income and retained earnings in
place of a statement of comprehensive income and a statement of changes in
equity if the only changes to its equity during the periods for which financial
statements are presented arise from profit or loss, payment of dividends,
corrections of prior period errors, and changes in accounting policy.
Information to be presented in the statement of income
and retained earnings
An entity shall present, in the statement of income and retained earnings, the
following items in addition to the information required by Section 5 Statement
of Comprehensive Income and Income Statement:
(a)
retained earnings at the beginning of the reporting period;
(b)
dividends declared and paid or payable during the period;
(c)
restatements of retained earnings for corrections of prior period
errors;
(d)
restatements of retained earnings for changes in accounting policy;
and
(e)
retained earnings at the end of the reporting period.
Information to be disclosed in the notes
An entity shall disclose in the notes:
(a)
the amount of dividends proposed (or declared) before the financial
statements were authorised for issue but not recognised as a
distribution to owners during the reporting period, and the amount
per share; and
(b)
the amount of any cumulative preference dividends not recognised.

 Section 7
Statement of Cash Flows
Scope of this section
This section sets out the information that is to be presented in a statement of
cash flows and how to present it. The statement of cash flows provides
information about the changes in cash and cash equivalents of an entity for a
reporting period, showing separately changes from operating activities,
investing activities and financing activities.
Cash equivalents
Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily
convertible to known amounts of cash and that are subject to an insignificant
risk of changes in value. They are held to meet short-term cash commitments
instead of for investment or other purposes. Consequently, an investment
normally qualifies as a cash equivalent only when it has a short maturity of,
say, three months or less from the date of acquisition. Bank overdrafts are
normally considered financing activities similar to borrowings. However, if
they are repayable on demand and form an integral part of an entity’s cash
management, bank overdrafts are a component of cash and cash equivalents.
Information to be presented in the statement of cash flows
An entity shall present a statement of cash flows that presents cash flows for
a reporting period classified by operating activities, investing activities and
financing activities.
Operating activities
Operating activities are the principal revenue-producing activities of the
entity. Consequently, cash flows from operating activities generally result
from the transactions and other events and conditions that enter into the
determination of profit or loss. Examples of cash flows from operating
activities are:
(a)
cash receipts from the sale of goods and the rendering of services;
(b)
cash receipts from royalties, fees, commissions and other revenue;
(c)
cash payments to suppliers for goods and services;
(d)
cash payments to and on behalf of employees;
(e)
cash payments or refunds of income tax, unless they can be specifically
identified with financing and investing activities; and
(f)
cash receipts and payments from investments, loans and other
contracts held for dealing or trading purposes, which are similar to
inventory acquired specifically for resale.
7.1
7.2
7.3
7.4
IFRS FOR SMES ACCOUNTING STANDARD
© IFRS Foundation
59
 Some transactions, such as the sale of an item of plant by a manufacturing
entity, may give rise to a gain or loss that is included in profit or loss.
However, the cash flows relating to such transactions are cash flows from
investing activities.
Investing activities
Investing activities are the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and
other investments not included in cash equivalents. Examples of cash flows
arising from investing activities are:
(a)
cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment (including
self-constructed property, plant and equipment), intangible assets and
other long-term assets;
(b)
cash receipts from sales of property, plant and equipment, intangibles
and other long-term assets;
(c)
cash payments to acquire equity or debt instruments of other entities
(other than payments for those instruments classified as cash
equivalents or held for dealing or trading);
(d)
cash receipts from sales of equity or debt instruments of other entities
(other than receipts for those instruments classified as cash
equivalents or held for dealing or trading);
(e)
cash advances and loans made to other parties;
(f)
cash receipts from the repayment of advances and loans made to other
parties;
(g)
cash payments for futures contracts, forward contracts, option
contracts and swap contracts, except when the contracts are held for
dealing or trading, or the payments are classified as financing
activities; and
(h)
cash receipts from futures contracts, forward contracts, option
contracts and swap contracts, except when the contracts are held for
dealing or trading, or the receipts are classified as financing activities.
When a contract is accounted for as a hedge (see Part II of Section 11 Financial
Instruments), an entity shall classify the cash flows of the contract in the same
manner as the cash flows of the item being hedged.
Financing activities
Financing activities are activities that result in changes in the size and
composition of the contributed equity and borrowings of an entity. Examples
of cash flows arising from financing activities are:
(a)
cash proceeds from issuing shares or other equity instruments;
(b)
cash payments to owners to acquire or redeem the entity’s shares;
(c)
cash proceeds from issuing debentures, loans, notes, bonds, mortgages
and other short-term or long-term borrowings;
7.5
7.6
FEBRUARY 2025
60
© IFRS Foundation
 (d)
cash repayments of amounts borrowed; and
(e)
cash payments by a lessee for the reduction of the outstanding liability
relating to a finance lease.
Reporting cash flows from operating activities
An entity shall present cash flows from operating activities using either:
(a)
the indirect method, whereby profit or loss is adjusted for the effects
of non-cash transactions, any deferrals or accruals of past or future
operating cash receipts or payments and items of income or expense
associated with investing or financing cash flows; or
(b)
the direct method, whereby major classes of gross cash receipts and
gross cash payments are disclosed.
Indirect method
Under the indirect method, the net cash flow from operating activities is
determined by adjusting profit or loss for the effects of:
(a)
changes during the period in inventories and operating receivables and
payables;
(b)
non-cash items such as depreciation, provisions, deferred tax,
accrued income (expenses) not yet received (paid) in cash, unrealised
foreign currency gains and losses, and undistributed profits of
associates; and
(c)
all other items for which the cash effects relate to investing or
financing.
Direct method
Under the direct method, net cash flow from operating activities is presented
by disclosing information about major classes of gross cash receipts and gross
cash payments. Such information may be obtained either:
(a)
from the accounting records of the entity; or
(b)
by adjusting sales, cost of sales and other items in the statement of
comprehensive income (or the income statement, if presented) for:
(i)
changes during the period in inventories and operating
receivables and payables;
(ii)
other non-cash items; and
(iii)
other items for which the cash effects are investing or
financing cash flows.

IFRS FOR SMES ACCOUNTING STANDARD

 Reporting cash flows from investing and financing activities
An entity shall present separately major classes of gross cash receipts and
gross cash payments arising from investing and financing activities. The
aggregate cash flows arising from acquisitions and from disposals of
subsidiaries or other business units shall be presented separately and
classified as investing activities.
Foreign currency cash flows
An entity shall record cash flows arising from transactions in a foreign
currency in the entity’s functional currency by applying to the foreign
currency amount the exchange rate between the functional currency and the
foreign currency at the date of the cash flow.
The entity shall translate cash flows of a foreign subsidiary at the exchange
rates between the entity’s functional currency and the foreign currency at the
dates of the cash flows.
Paragraph 30.19 explains when an exchange rate that approximates the actual
rate can be used.
Unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in foreign currency exchange
rates are not cash flows. However, to reconcile cash and cash equivalents at
the beginning and the end of the period, the effect of exchange rate changes
on cash and cash equivalents held or due in a foreign currency must be
presented in the statement of cash flows. Consequently, the entity shall
remeasure cash and cash equivalents held during the reporting period (such as
amounts of foreign currency held and foreign currency bank accounts) at
period-end exchange rates. The entity shall present the resulting unrealised
gain or loss separately from cash flows from operating, investing and
financing activities.
Interest and dividends
An entity shall present separately cash flows from interest and dividends
received and paid. The entity shall classify cash flows consistently from period
to period as operating, investing or financing activities.
An entity may classify interest paid and interest and dividends received as
operating cash flows because they are included in profit or loss. Alternatively,
the entity may classify interest paid and interest and dividends received as
financing cash flows and investing cash flows respectively, because they are
costs of obtaining financial resources or returns on investments.
An entity may classify dividends paid as a financing cash flow because they
are a cost of obtaining financial resources. Alternatively, the entity may
classify dividends paid as a component of cash flows from operating activities
because they are paid out of operating cash flows.

 Income tax
An entity shall present separately cash flows arising from income tax and
shall classify them as cash flows from operating activities unless they can be
specifically identified with financing and investing activities. When tax cash
flows are allocated over more than one class of activity, the entity shall
disclose the total amount of taxes paid.
Non-cash transactions
An entity shall exclude from the statement of cash flows investing and
financing transactions that do not require the use of cash or cash equivalents.
An entity shall disclose such transactions elsewhere in the financial
statements in a way that provides all the relevant information about those
investing and financing activities.
Many investing and financing activities do not have a direct impact on current
cash flows even though they affect the capital and asset structure of an entity.
The exclusion of non-cash transactions from the statement of cash flows is
consistent with the objective of a statement of cash flows because these items
do not involve cash flows in the current period. Examples of non-cash
transactions are:
(a)
the acquisition of assets either by assuming directly related liabilities
or by means of a finance lease;
(b)
the acquisition of an entity by means of an equity issue; and
(c)
the conversion of debt to equity.
Changes in liabilities arising from financing activities
An entity shall disclose a reconciliation between the opening and closing
balances in the statement of financial position for liabilities arising from
financing activities. Liabilities arising from financing activities are liabilities
for which cash flows were, or future cash flows will be, classified in the
statement of cash flows as cash flows from financing activities. An entity shall
include in the reconciliation:
(a)
changes from financing cash flows;
(b)
changes arising from obtaining or losing control of subsidiaries or
other businesses;
(c)
the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates;
(d)
changes in fair values; and
(e)
other changes.

 Supplier finance arrangements
Supplier finance arrangements are characterised by one or more finance
providers offering to pay amounts an entity owes its suppliers and the entity
agreeing to pay according to the terms and conditions of the arrangements at
the same date as, or a date later than, suppliers are paid. These arrangements
provide the entity with extended payment terms, or the entity’s suppliers with
early payment terms, compared to the related invoice payment due date.
Supplier finance arrangements are often referred to as ‘supply chain finance’,
‘payables finance’ or ‘reverse factoring arrangements’. Examples of
arrangements that are not supplier finance arrangements include:
(a)
arrangements that are solely credit enhancements for an entity (for
example, financial guarantees including letters of credit used as
guarantees); and
(b)
instruments used by an entity to settle directly with a supplier the
amounts owed (for example, a situation in which an entity uses a
credit card to settle the amount owed to a supplier and then has an
obligation to pay the issuing bank instead).
An entity shall disclose in aggregate for its supplier finance arrangements:
(a)
the key terms and conditions of the arrangements (for example, terms
and conditions related to the interest rate, fees charged, extended
payment terms and security or guarantees provided). However, an
entity shall disclose separately the terms and conditions of
arrangements that have dissimilar key terms and conditions.
(b)
as at the beginning and end of the reporting period:
(i)
the carrying amounts, and associated line items presented in
the entity’s statement of financial position, of the financial
liabilities that are part of a supplier finance arrangement.
(ii)
the carrying amounts, and associated line items, of the
financial liabilities disclosed in accordance with (i) for which
suppliers have already received payment from the finance
providers, unless it is impracticable to do so. If it is
impracticable to make this disclosure, the entity shall state that
fact.
(iii)
the range of payment due dates (for example, 30–40 days after
the invoice date) for both the financial liabilities disclosed in
accordance with (i) and comparable trade payables that are not
part of the supplier finance arrangement. Comparable trade
payables are, for example, the entity’s trade payables within
the same line of business or jurisdiction as the financial
liabilities disclosed in accordance with (i). If ranges of payment
due dates are wide, an entity shall disclose explanatory
information about those ranges or divide them into narrower
ranges.

 (c)
the type and effect of non-cash changes in the carrying amounts of the
financial liabilities disclosed in accordance with (b)(i). These non-cash
changes include the effect of business combinations, exchange
differences and other transactions that do not require the use of cash
or cash equivalents (see paragraph 7.18). For example, an entity that
buys goods and services from suppliers would typically classify the
cash outflows to settle amounts owed to its suppliers as cash outflows
from operating activities. If the entity owes its suppliers an amount
that becomes part of a supplier finance arrangement, the entity—
having considered the terms and conditions of the arrangement—
might classify the cash outflow to settle the amount owed as a cash
flow from financing activities. In such circumstances, the entity might
not have reported any cash inflow from financing activities, in which
case the outcome would be a non-cash change in liabilities arising
from financing activities.
Components of cash and cash equivalents
An entity shall disclose the components of cash and cash equivalents and shall
present a reconciliation of the amounts in the statement of cash flows with
the equivalent items reported in the statement of financial position. However,
an entity is not required to present this reconciliation if the amount of cash
and cash equivalents presented in the statement of cash flows is identical to
the amount similarly described in the statement of financial position.
Other disclosures
An entity shall disclose, together with a commentary by management, the
amount of significant cash and cash equivalent balances held by the entity
that are not available for use by the entity. Cash and cash equivalents held by
an entity may not be available for use by the entity because of, among other
reasons, foreign exchange controls or legal restrictions.

 Section 8
Notes to the Financial Statements
Scope of this section
This section sets out the principles underlying information that is to be
presented in the notes to the financial statements and how to present it.
Notes contain information in addition to that presented in the statement of
financial position, the statement of comprehensive income (if presented),
the income statement (if presented), the combined statement of income and
retained earnings (if presented), the statement of changes in equity (if
presented) and the statement of cash flows. Notes provide narrative
descriptions or disaggregations of items presented in those statements and
information about items that do not qualify for recognition in those
statements. In addition to the requirements of this section, nearly every other
section of this Standard requires disclosures that are normally presented in
the notes.
Structure of the notes
The notes shall:
(a)
present information about the basis of preparation of the financial
statements and the specific accounting policies used, in accordance
with paragraphs 8.5–8.7;
(b)
disclose the information required by this Standard that is not
presented elsewhere in the financial statements; and
(c)
provide information that is not presented elsewhere in the financial
statements but is relevant to an understanding of any of them.
An entity shall, as far as practicable, present the notes in a systematic manner.
An entity shall cross-reference each item in the financial statements to any
related information in the notes.
An entity normally presents the notes in the following order:
(a)
a statement that the financial statements have been prepared in
compliance with the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard (see
paragraph 3.3);
(b)
material accounting policy information (see paragraph 8.5);
(c)
supporting information for items presented in the financial
statements, in the sequence in which each statement and each line
item is presented; and
(d)
any other disclosures.

 Disclosure of accounting policies
An entity shall disclose material accounting policy information. Accounting
policy information is material if, when considered together with other
information included in the entity’s financial statements, it can reasonably be
expected to influence decisions that the primary users of general purpose
financial statements make on the basis of those financial statements.
Information about judgements
An entity shall disclose, along with material accounting policy information or
other notes, the judgements, apart from those involving estimations (see
paragraph 8.7), that management has made in the process of applying the
entity’s accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the
amounts recognised in the financial statements. Examples of judgements that
an entity might be required to disclose include those made in determining:
(a)
appropriate classes of assets and liabilities in accordance with
paragraph 12.30 for which disclosures about fair value measurements
are provided;
(b)
that the entity has control of another entity; and
(c)
that the entity has joint control of an arrangement or significant
influence over another entity.
Information about key sources of estimation uncertainty
An entity shall disclose in the notes information about the key assumptions
concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the
reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment
to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial
year. In respect of those assets and liabilities, the notes shall include details of:
(a)
their nature; and
(b)
their carrying amount as at the end of the reporting period.

 Section 9
Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements
Scope of this section
This section defines the circumstances in which an entity applying this
Standard presents consolidated financial statements and the procedures for
preparing those statements in accordance with this Standard. It also includes
guidance on separate financial statements and combined financial
statements if they are prepared in accordance with this Standard. If a parent
by itself does not have public accountability, it may present its separate
financial statements in accordance with this Standard, even if it presents its
consolidated financial statements in accordance with full IFRS Accounting
Standards or another set of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
Requirement to present consolidated financial statements
Except as permitted or required by paragraphs 9.3 and 9.3C, a parent shall
present consolidated financial statements. Consolidated financial statements
shall include all subsidiaries of the parent, except subsidiaries to which
paragraph 9.3A applies.
A parent need not present consolidated financial statements if both of the
following conditions are met:
(a)
the parent is itself a subsidiary; and
(b)
its ultimate parent (or any intermediate parent) produces consolidated
general purpose financial statements that comply with full IFRS
Accounting Standards or with this Standard.
Subject to paragraph 9.3B, a subsidiary is not consolidated if it is acquired and
is held with the intention of selling or disposing of it within one year from its
acquisition date (see paragraph 19.11). Such a subsidiary is accounted for in
accordance with the requirements in Section 11 Financial Instruments for
investments in paragraph 11.8(d), instead of in accordance with this section.
The parent shall also provide the disclosure required in paragraph 9.23A.
If a subsidiary previously excluded from consolidation in accordance with
paragraph 9.3A is not disposed of within one year from its acquisition date:
(a)
the parent shall consolidate the subsidiary from the acquisition date
unless it meets the condition in paragraph 9.3B(b). Consequently, if the
acquisition date was in a prior period, the relevant prior periods shall
be restated.
(b)
if the delay is caused by events or circumstances beyond the parent’s
control and there is sufficient evidence at the reporting date that the
parent remains committed to its plan to sell or dispose of the
subsidiary, the parent shall continue to account for the subsidiary in
accordance with paragraph 9.3A.

 If a parent has no subsidiaries other than subsidiaries that are not
consolidated in accordance with paragraphs 9.3A–9.3B, it shall not present
consolidated financial statements. However, the parent shall provide the
disclosure required in paragraph 9.23A.
A subsidiary is not excluded from consolidation because:
(a)
the investor is a venture capital organisation or similar entity.
(b)
its business activities are dissimilar to those of the other entities
within the consolidation. Relevant information is provided by
consolidating such subsidiaries and disclosing additional information
in the consolidated financial statements about the different business
activities of subsidiaries.
(c)
it operates in a jurisdiction that imposes restrictions on transferring
cash or other assets out of the jurisdiction.
Control
A subsidiary is an entity (an investee) that is controlled by another entity (an
investor). An investor, regardless of the nature of its involvement with an
investee, shall determine whether it is a parent by assessing whether it
controls the investee.
An investor controls an investee when the investor is exposed, or has rights, to
variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to
affect those returns through its power over the investee.
Thus, an investor controls an investee if the investor has all the following:
(a)
power over the investee;
(b)
exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the
investee; and
(c)
the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of
the investor’s returns.
An investor shall consider all facts and circumstances when assessing whether
it controls an investee. The investor shall reassess whether it controls an
investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or
more of the three elements of control listed in paragraph 9.4B.
Control is presumed to exist when the investor owns, directly or indirectly
through subsidiaries, a majority of the voting rights of an investee. An
investor that owns, directly or indirectly through subsidiaries, a majority of
the voting rights of an investee is not required to assess whether it has the
elements of control listed in paragraph 9.4B. However, the presumption can
be rebutted if it can be clearly demonstrated that the investor does not have
one or more of the elements of control listed in paragraph 9.4B—for example,
if the investor owns a majority of the voting rights of an investee, but another
entity has existing rights that give that entity the current ability to direct the
relevant activities through contractual arrangements.

 Power
An investor has power over an investee when the investor has existing rights
that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities, that is, the
activities that significantly affect the investee’s returns. Depending on the
circumstances, relevant activities can include:
(a)
selling and purchasing goods or services;
(b)
selecting, acquiring or disposing of assets;
(c)
researching and developing new products or processes; and
(d)
determining a funding structure or obtaining funding.
An investor with the current ability to direct the relevant activities has power
even if its rights to direct have yet to be exercised. Evidence that the investor
has been directing relevant activities can help determine whether the investor
has power, but is not, in itself, conclusive in determining whether the investor
has power over an investee.
If two or more investors each have existing rights that give them the
unilateral ability to direct different relevant activities, the investor that has
the current ability to direct the activities that most significantly affect the
returns of the investee has power over the investee.
An investor will typically have power when it holds a majority of the voting
rights of an investee (see paragraph 9.5). However, an investor can have power
even if it holds less than a majority of the voting rights of an investee, for
example, through:
(a)
a 
contractual 
arrangement 
between 
the 
investor 
and 
other
vote-holders;
(b)
rights arising from other contractual arrangements;
(c)
the investor’s voting rights;
(d)
potential voting rights (see paragraph 9.8); or
(e)
a combination of (a)–(d).
When determining whether it has power, an investor considers its potential
voting rights as well as potential voting rights held by other parties. Potential
voting rights are rights to obtain voting rights of an investee, such as those
arising from convertible instruments or options, including forward contracts.
Those potential voting rights are considered only if the holder of the right has
the practical ability to exercise that right. Usually, for the holder of the right
to have the practical ability to exercise that right, the right needs to be
currently exercisable.
If an investor also has voting or other decision-making rights relating to the
investee’s relevant activities, the investor assesses whether those rights, in
combination with potential voting rights, give the investor power.

 Returns
An investor is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement
with the investee when the investor’s returns from its involvement have the
potential to vary as a result of the investee’s performance. The investor’s
returns can be only positive, only negative or both positive and negative.
Link between power and returns
For an investor to control an investee, the investor must have not only power
over the investee and exposure or rights to variable returns from its
involvement with the investee, but also the ability to use its power to affect its
returns from its involvement with the investee.
When an investor with decision-making rights (a decision-maker) assesses
whether it controls an investee, it shall determine whether it is a principal or
an agent. An investor shall also determine whether another entity with
decision-making rights is acting as an agent for the investor. An agent is a
party primarily engaged to act on behalf, and for the benefit, of another party
or parties (the principal(s)) and therefore does not control the investee when it
exercises its decision-making authority. Thus, sometimes a principal’s power
may be held and exercisable by an agent, but on behalf of the principal. A
decision-maker is not an agent simply because other parties can benefit from
the decisions that it makes.
Consolidation procedures
The consolidated financial statements present financial information about the
group as a single economic entity. In preparing consolidated financial
statements, an entity shall:
(a)
combine the financial statements of the parent and its subsidiaries
line by line by adding together like items of assets, liabilities, equity,
income and expenses.
(b)
eliminate the carrying amount of the parent’s investment in each
subsidiary and the parent’s portion of equity of each subsidiary.
(c)
measure and present non-controlling interest in the profit or loss and
total comprehensive income of consolidated subsidiaries for the
reporting period separately from the interest of the owners of the
parent.
(d)
measure and present non-controlling interest in the net assets of
consolidated subsidiaries separately from the parent shareholders’
equity in them. Non-controlling interest in the net assets consists of:
(i)
the amount of the non-controlling interest at the date of the
original combination calculated in accordance with Section 19
Business Combinations and Goodwill; and
(ii)
the non-controlling interest’s share of changes in equity since
the date of the combination.

9.11
9.12

IFRS FOR SMES ACCOUNTING STANDARD

 The proportions of profit or loss and changes in equity allocated to the owners
of the parent and to the non-controlling interest are determined on the basis
of existing ownership interests and do not reflect the possible exercise or
conversion of potential voting rights, and other options or convertible
instruments.
Intragroup balances and transactions
Intragroup balances and transactions, including income, expenses and
dividends, are eliminated in full. Profits and losses resulting from intragroup
transactions that are recognised in assets, such as inventory and property,
plant and equipment, are eliminated in full. Intragroup losses may indicate
an impairment that requires recognition in the consolidated financial
statements (see Section 27 Impairment of Assets). Section 29 Income Tax applies to
temporary differences that arise from the elimination of profits and losses
resulting from intragroup transactions.
Uniform reporting date
The financial statements of the parent and its subsidiaries used in the
preparation of the consolidated financial statements shall be prepared as of
the same reporting date unless it is impracticable to do so. If it is
impracticable to prepare the financial statements of a subsidiary as of the
same reporting date as the parent, the parent shall consolidate the financial
information of the subsidiary using the most recent financial statements of
the subsidiary, adjusted for the effects of significant transactions or events
that occur between the date of those financial statements and the date of the
consolidated financial statements.
Uniform accounting policies
Consolidated financial statements shall be prepared using uniform
accounting policies for like transactions and other events and conditions in
similar circumstances. If a member of the group uses accounting policies
other than those adopted in the consolidated financial statements for like
transactions and events in similar circumstances, appropriate adjustments are
made to its financial statements in preparing the consolidated financial
statements.
Acquisition and disposal of subsidiaries
The income and expenses of a subsidiary are included in the consolidated
financial statements from the acquisition date until the date on which the
parent loses control of the subsidiary.

 If a parent loses control of a subsidiary, the parent:
(a)
derecognises:
(i)
the assets (including any goodwill) and liabilities at their
carrying amounts at the date control is lost in the former
subsidiary; and
(ii)
the carrying amount of any non-controlling interests in the
former subsidiary at the date control is lost (including any
components of other comprehensive income attributable to
them);
(b)
recognises:
(i)
the fair value of the consideration received, if any, from the
transaction or event that resulted in the loss of control; and
(ii)
any interest retained in the former subsidiary at its fair value at
the date control is lost; and
(c)
recognises the gain or loss associated with the loss of control
attributable to the former controlling interest in profit or loss.
If a parent loses control of a subsidiary, the parent shall account for all
amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income for that
subsidiary, except for the cumulative amount of any exchange differences that
relate to a foreign subsidiary, on the same basis as would be required if the
parent had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. The cumulative
amount of any exchange differences that relate to a foreign subsidiary
recognised in other comprehensive income in accordance with Section 30
Foreign Currency Translation is not reclassified to profit or loss on disposal of the
subsidiary.
If a parent loses control of a subsidiary but continues to hold an interest in the
former subsidiary, that interest shall be accounted for in accordance with
other sections of this Standard. If the retained interest is a financial asset,
Section 11 Financial Instruments applies; if it is an associate, Section 14
Investments in Associates applies; if it is a jointly controlled entity, Section 15
Joint Arrangements applies. The fair value at the date control is lost shall be
regarded as the fair value on initial recognition of a financial asset or the cost
on initial recognition of an investment in an associate or jointly controlled
entity, if applicable.
Non-controlling interest in subsidiaries
An entity shall present non-controlling interest in the consolidated statement
of financial position within equity, separately from the equity of the owners
of the parent, as required by paragraph 4.2(q).
An entity shall treat changes in a parent’s controlling interest in a subsidiary
that do not result in a loss of control as transactions with owners in their
capacity as owners. Accordingly, the carrying amount of the non-controlling
interest shall be adjusted to reflect the change in the parent’s interest in the
9.18A
9.18B
9.19
9.20
9.20A

© IFRS Foundation
73
 subsidiary’s net assets. Any difference between the amount by which the
non-controlling interest is so adjusted and the fair value of the consideration
paid or received, if any, shall be recognised directly in equity and attributed to
owners of the parent. An entity shall not recognise any gain or loss on these
changes. Also, an entity shall not recognise any change in the carrying
amounts of assets (including goodwill) or liabilities as a result of such
transactions.
An entity shall disclose non-controlling interest in the profit or loss of the
group separately in the statement of comprehensive income, as required by
paragraph 5.6 (or in the income statement, if presented, as required by
paragraph 5.7).
Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income shall be
attributed to the owners of the parent and to the non-controlling interest.
Total comprehensive income shall be attributed to the owners of the parent
and to the non-controlling interest even if this results in the non-controlling
interest having a deficit balance.
Disclosures in consolidated financial statements
The following disclosures shall be made in consolidated financial statements:
(a)
the fact that the financial statements are consolidated financial
statements;
(b)
[deleted]
(c)
any difference in the reporting date of the financial statements of the
parent and its subsidiaries used in the preparation of the consolidated
financial statements; and
(d)
the nature and extent of any significant restrictions (for example
resulting from borrowing arrangements or regulatory requirements)
on the ability of subsidiaries to transfer funds to the parent in the
form of cash dividends or to repay loans.
In addition to the disclosure requirements in Section 11, a parent shall
disclose the carrying amount of investments in subsidiaries that are not
consolidated (see paragraphs 9.3A–9.3C) at the reporting date, in total, either
in the statement of financial position or in the notes.
An entity shall disclose the gain or loss, if any, calculated in accordance with
paragraphs 9.18–9.18B, and:
(a)
the portion of that gain or loss attributable to measuring any interest
retained in the former subsidiary at its fair value at the date control is
lost; and
(b)
the line items in profit or loss in which the gain or loss is recognised (if
not presented separately).

 Separate financial statements
Presentation of separate financial statements
This Standard does not require presentation of separate financial statements
for the parent or for the individual subsidiaries.
Separate financial statements are presented by an entity in addition to any of
the following:
(a)
consolidated financial statements prepared by a parent;
(b)
financial statements prepared by a parent exempted from preparing
consolidated financial statements by paragraph 9.3C; or
(c)
financial statements prepared by an entity that is not a parent but has
significant influence over an associate or has joint control of a jointly
controlled entity.
A parent that is exempt in accordance with paragraph 9.3 from preparing
consolidated financial statements is permitted to present separate financial
statements as its only financial statements.
Accounting policy election
When an entity prepares separate financial statements and describes them as
conforming to the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard, those statements shall
comply with all of the requirements of this Standard except as follows. The
entity shall adopt a policy of accounting for its investments in subsidiaries,
associates and jointly controlled entities in its separate financial statements
either:
(a)
at cost less impairment;
(b)
at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss; or
(c)
using the equity method following the procedures in paragraph 14.8.
The entity shall apply the same accounting policy for all investments in a
single class (subsidiaries, associates or jointly controlled entities), but it can
elect different policies for different classes.
Disclosures in separate financial statements
When an entity prepares separate financial statements, those separate
financial statements shall disclose:
(a)
that the statements are separate financial statements;
(b)
a description of the methods used to account for the investments in
subsidiaries, jointly controlled entities and associates; and
(c)
either:
(i)
the consolidated financial statements or other financial
statements to which they relate; or

incorporation, if different) of the entity whose consolidated
financial statements comply with full IFRS Accounting
Standards or with this Standard, if the entity has chosen not to
prepare consolidated financial statements in accordance with
paragraph 9.3.
Combined financial statements
Combined financial statements are the financial statements of a reporting
entity that comprises two or more entities that are not all linked by a
parent–subsidiary relationship. This Standard does not require combined
financial statements to be prepared.
If the investor prepares combined financial statements and describes them as
conforming to the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard, those statements shall
comply with all of the requirements of this Standard. Intercompany
transactions and balances shall be eliminated; profits or losses resulting from
intercompany transactions that are recognised in assets such as inventory and
property, plant and equipment shall be eliminated; the financial statements of
the entities included in the combined financial statements shall be prepared
as of the same reporting date unless it is impracticable to do so; and uniform
accounting policies shall be followed for like transactions and other events in
similar circumstances.
Disclosures in combined financial statements
The combined financial statements shall disclose the following:
(a)
the fact that the financial statements are combined financial
statements;
(b)
the reason why combined financial statements are prepared;
(c)
the basis for determining which entities are included in the combined
financial statements;
(d)
the basis of preparation of the combined financial statements; and

 Section 10
Accounting Policies, Estimates and Errors
Scope of this section
This section provides guidance for selecting and applying the accounting
policies used in preparing financial statements. It also covers changes in
accounting estimates and corrections of errors in prior period financial
statements.
Selection and application of accounting policies
Accounting policies are the specific principles, bases, conventions, rules and
practices applied by an entity in preparing and presenting financial
statements.
If this Standard specifically addresses a transaction, other event or condition,
an entity shall apply this Standard. However, the entity need not follow a
requirement in this Standard if the effect of doing so would not be material.
If this Standard does not specifically address a transaction, other event or
condition, an entity’s management shall use its judgement in developing and
applying an accounting policy that results in information that is:
(a)
relevant to the economic decision-making needs of users; and
(b)
reliable, in that the financial statements:
(i)
represent 
faithfully 
the 
financial 
position, 
financial
performance and cash flows of the entity;
(ii)
reflect the economic substance of transactions, other events
and conditions, and not merely the legal form;
(iii)
are neutral, ie free from bias;
(iv)
are prudent; and
(v)
are complete in all material respects.
In making the judgement described in paragraph 10.4, management shall
refer to, and consider the applicability of, the following sources in descending
order:
(a)
the requirements and guidance in this Standard dealing with similar
and related issues; and
(b)
the definitions, recognition criteria and measurement concepts for
assets, liabilities, income and expenses and the pervasive principles in
Section 2 Concepts and Pervasive Principles.
In making the judgement described in paragraph 10.4, management may also
consider the requirements and guidance in full IFRS Accounting Standards
dealing with similar and related issues.

 Consistency of accounting policies
An entity shall select and apply its accounting policies consistently for similar
transactions, other events and conditions, unless this Standard specifically
requires or permits categorisation of items for which different policies may be
appropriate. If this Standard requires or permits such categorisation, an
appropriate accounting policy shall be selected and applied consistently to
each category.
Changes in accounting policies
An entity shall change an accounting policy only if the change:
(a)
is required by changes to this Standard; or
(b)
results in the financial statements providing reliable and more
relevant information about the effects of transactions, other events or
conditions on the entity’s financial position, financial performance or
cash flows.
The following are not changes in accounting policies:
(a)
the application of an accounting policy for transactions, other events
or conditions that differ in substance from those previously occurring;
(b)
the application of a new accounting policy for transactions, other
events or conditions that did not occur previously or were not
material; or
(c)
a change to the cost model when a reliable measure of fair value is no
longer available (or vice versa) for an asset that this Standard would
otherwise require or permit to be measured at fair value.
If this Standard allows a choice of accounting treatment (including the
measurement basis) for a specified transaction or other event or condition
and an entity changes its previous choice, that is a change in accounting
policy.
The initial application of a policy to revalue assets in accordance with
Section 17 Property, Plant and Equipment is a change in an accounting policy to
be dealt with as a revaluation in accordance with Section 17. Consequently, a
change from the cost model to the revaluation model for a class of property,
plant and equipment shall be accounted for prospectively, instead of in
accordance with paragraphs 10.11–10.12.
Applying changes in accounting policies
An entity shall account for:
(a)
a change in accounting policy resulting from a change in the
requirements of this Standard in accordance with the transitional
provisions, if any, specified in Appendix A of this Standard; and
(b)
all 
other 
changes 
in 
accounting 
policy 
retrospectively 
(see
paragraph 10.12).

 Retrospective application
When a change in accounting policy is applied retrospectively in accordance
with paragraph 10.11, the entity shall apply the new accounting policy to
comparative information for prior periods to the earliest date for which it is
practicable, as if the new accounting policy had always been applied. When it
is impracticable to determine the individual-period effects of a change in
accounting policy on comparative information for one or more prior periods
presented, the entity shall apply the new accounting policy to the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities as at the beginning of the earliest period for
which retrospective application is practicable, which may be the current
period, and shall make a corresponding adjustment to the opening balance of
each affected component of equity for that period.
Disclosure of a change in accounting policy
When an amendment to this Standard has an effect on the current period or
any prior period, or might have an effect on future periods, an entity shall
disclose the following:
(a)
the nature of the change in accounting policy;
(b)
for the current period and each prior period presented, to the extent
practicable, the amount of the adjustment for each financial statement
line item affected;
(c)
the amount of the adjustment relating to periods before those
presented, to the extent practicable; and
(d)
an explanation if it is impracticable to determine the amounts to be
disclosed in (b) or (c).
Financial statements of subsequent periods need not repeat these disclosures.
When a voluntary change in accounting policy has an effect on the current
period or any prior period, an entity shall disclose the following:
(a)
the nature of the change in accounting policy;
(b)
the reasons why applying the new accounting policy provides reliable
and more relevant information;
(c)
to the extent practicable, the amount of the adjustment for each
financial statement line item affected, shown separately:
(i)
for the current period;
(ii)
for each prior period presented; and
(iii)
in the aggregate for periods before those presented.
(d)
an explanation if it is impracticable to determine the amounts to be
disclosed in (c).
Financial statements of subsequent periods need not repeat these disclosures.

 Accounting estimates
An accounting policy might require items in financial statements to be
measured in a way that involves measurement uncertainty—that is, the
accounting policy might require such items to be measured at monetary
amounts that cannot be observed directly and must instead be estimated. In
such cases, the entity develops an accounting estimate to achieve the objective
set out by the accounting policy. Developing accounting estimates involves the
use of judgements or assumptions based on the latest available, reliable
information.
An entity uses measurement techniques and inputs to develop an accounting
estimate. Measurement techniques include estimation techniques (for
example, techniques used to measure depreciation for an item of property,
plant and equipment, applying Section 17) and valuation techniques (for
example, techniques used to measure the fair value of an asset or liability
applying Section 12 Fair Value Measurement).
Changes in accounting estimates
An entity may need to change an accounting estimate if changes occur in the
circumstances on which the accounting estimate was based or as a result of
new information, developments or more experience.
The effects on an accounting estimate of a change in an input or a change in a
measurement technique are changes in accounting estimates unless they
result from the correction of prior period errors. A change in the
measurement basis applied is a change in an accounting policy and is not a
change in an accounting estimate. When it is difficult to distinguish a change
in an accounting policy from a change in an accounting estimate, the change
is treated as a change in an accounting estimate.
An entity shall recognise the effect of a change in an accounting estimate,
other than a change to which paragraph 10.17 applies, prospectively by
including it in profit or loss in:
(a)
the period of the change, if the change affects that period only; or
(b)
the period of the change and future periods, if the change affects both.
To the extent that a change in an accounting estimate gives rise to changes in
assets and liabilities, or relates to an item of equity, the entity shall recognise
it by adjusting the carrying amount of the related asset, liability or equity
item in the period of the change.
Disclosure of a change in accounting estimates
An entity shall disclose the nature of any change in an accounting estimate
and the effect of the change on assets, liabilities, income and expense for the
current period. If it is practicable for the entity to estimate the effect of the
change in one or more future periods, the entity shall disclose those estimates.

 Corrections of prior period errors
Prior period errors are omissions from, and misstatements in, an entity’s
financial statements for one or more prior periods arising from a failure to
use, or misuse of, reliable information that:
(a)
was available when financial statements for those periods were
authorised for issue; and
(b)
could reasonably be expected to have been obtained and taken into
account in the preparation and presentation of those financial
statements.
Such errors include the effects of mathematical mistakes, mistakes in
applying accounting policies, oversights or misinterpretations of facts and
fraud.
To the extent practicable, an entity shall correct a material prior period error
retrospectively in the first financial statements authorised for issue after its
discovery by:
(a)
restating the comparative amounts for the prior period(s) presented in
which the error occurred; or
(b)
if the error occurred before the earliest prior period presented,
restating the opening balances of assets, liabilities and equity for the
earliest prior period presented.
When it is impracticable to determine the effects of an error on comparative
information for one or more prior periods presented, the entity shall restate
the opening balances of assets, liabilities and equity for the earliest period for
which retrospective restatement is practicable (which may be the current
period).
Disclosure of prior period errors
An entity shall disclose the following about prior period errors:
(a)
the nature of the prior period error;
(b)
for each prior period presented, to the extent practicable, the amount
of the correction for each financial statement line item affected;
(c)
to the extent practicable, the amount of the correction at the
beginning of the earliest prior period presented; and
(d)
an explanation if it is not practicable to determine the amounts to be
disclosed in (b) or (c).
Financial statements of subsequent periods need not repeat these disclosures.

 Section 11
Financial Instruments
Scope of this section
Section 11 Financial Instruments deals with recognising, derecognising,
measuring and disclosing financial instruments (financial assets and
financial liabilities). Part I of Section 11 applies to basic financial instruments
and is relevant to all entities. Part II of Section 11 applies to other, more
complex financial instruments and transactions. If an entity enters into only
basic financial instrument transactions, then Part II of Section 11 is not
applicable. However, all entities shall consider the scope of Part II of
Section 11 to ensure they are exempt.
[Deleted]
Part I of Section 11
Basic Financial Instruments
Introduction to Part I of Section 11
A financial instrument is a contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one
entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.
Part I of Section 11 requires an amortised cost model for all basic financial
instruments except for investments in non-convertible preference shares and
non-puttable ordinary or preference shares that are publicly traded or whose
fair value can otherwise be measured reliably without undue cost or effort.
Basic financial instruments within the scope of Part I of Section 11 are those
that satisfy the conditions in paragraph 11.8. Examples of financial
instruments that normally satisfy those conditions include:
(a)
cash;
(b)
demand and fixed-term deposits when the entity is the depositor, for
example bank accounts;
(c)
commercial paper and commercial bills held;
(d)
accounts, notes and loans receivable and payable;
(e)
bonds and similar debt instruments;
(f)
investments in non-convertible preference shares and non-puttable
ordinary and preference shares; and
(g)
commitments to receive a loan if the commitment cannot be net
settled in cash.
Examples of financial instruments that do not normally satisfy the conditions
in paragraph 11.8, and are therefore within the scope of Part II of Section 11,
include:

11.2
11.3
11.4

 (a)
asset-backed securities, such as collateralised mortgage obligations,
repurchase agreements and securitised packages of receivables;
(b)
options, rights, warrants, futures contracts, forward contracts and
interest rate swaps that can be settled in cash or by exchanging
another financial instrument;
(c)
financial instruments that qualify and are designated as hedging
instruments in accordance with the requirements in Part II of
Section 11;
(d)
commitments to make a loan to another entity;
(e)
commitments to receive a loan if the commitment can be net settled in
cash;
(f)
contingent consideration recognised by an acquirer in a business
combination; and
(g)
issued financial guarantee contracts—however, financial guarantee
contracts issued at nil consideration when the specified debtor is
another entity within the group are in the scope of Section 21
Provisions and Contingencies (see paragraph 21.1A).
Scope of Part I of Section 11
Part I of Section 11 applies to all financial instruments meeting the conditions
of paragraph 11.8 except for the following:
(a)
interests in subsidiaries and associates and joint arrangements that
are accounted for in accordance with Section 9 Consolidated and Separate
Financial Statements, Section 14 Investments in Associates or Section 15 Joint
Arrangements.
(b)
financial instruments that meet the definition of an entity’s own
equity, including the equity component of compound financial
instruments issued by the entity (see Section 22 Liabilities and Equity).
(c)
leases, to which Section 20 Leases or paragraph 11.49(f) apply. However,
the derecognition requirements in paragraphs 11.33–11.38 apply to
the derecognition of lease receivables recognised by a lessor and lease
payables recognised by a lessee, and the impairment requirements in
paragraphs 11.21–11.26 apply to lease receivables recognised by a
lessor.
(d)
employers’ rights and obligations under employee benefit plans, to
which Section 28 Employee Benefits applies.
(e)
financial instruments, contracts and obligations under share-based
payment transactions to which Section 26 Share-based Payment applies.
(f)
reimbursement assets that are accounted for in accordance with
Section 21 (see paragraph 21.9).
11.7
IFRS FOR SMES ACCOUNTING STANDARD
© IFRS Foundation
83
 (g)
rights and obligations within the scope of Section 23 Revenue from
Contracts with Customers that are financial instruments, except for trade
receivables that meet the conditions in paragraph 11.8(b).
The impairment requirements in paragraphs 11.21–11.26 apply to contract
assets.
Basic financial instruments
An entity shall account for the following financial instruments as basic
financial instruments in accordance with Part I of Section 11:
(a)
cash;
(b)
a debt instrument (such as an account, note or loan receivable or
payable) 
that 
meets 
the 
conditions 
in 
paragraph 
11.9 
or
paragraph 11.9ZA;
(c)
a commitment to receive a loan that:
(i)
cannot be settled net in cash; and
(ii)
when the commitment is executed, is expected to meet the
conditions in paragraph 11.9.
(d)
an investment in non-convertible preference shares and non-puttable
ordinary shares or preference shares.
A debt instrument that satisfies all of the conditions in (a)–(d) shall be
accounted for in accordance with Part I of Section 11:
(a)
returns to the holder (the lender/creditor) assessed in the currency in
which the debt instrument is denominated are either:
(i)
a fixed amount;
(ii)
a fixed rate of return over the life of the instrument;
(iii)
a variable return that, throughout the life of the instrument, is
equal to a single referenced quoted or observable interest rate
(such as Sterling Overnight Indexed Average (SONIA)); or
(iv)
some combination of such fixed and variable rates, provided
that both the fixed and variable rates are positive (for example,
an interest rate swap with a positive fixed rate and negative
variable rate would not meet this criterion).
For fixed and variable rate interest returns, interest is calculated by
multiplying the rate for the applicable period by the principal amount
outstanding during the period.
(b)
there is no contractual provision that could, by its terms, result in the
holder (the lender/creditor) losing the principal amount or any interest
attributable to the current period or prior periods. The fact that a debt
instrument is subordinated to other debt instruments is not an
example of such a contractual provision. A party may pay or receive
11.7A
11.8
11.9
FEBRUARY 2025
84
© IFRS Foundation
 reasonable compensation on early termination of a contract and still
meet this condition.
(c)
contractual provisions that permit or require the issuer (the borrower)
to prepay a debt instrument or permit or require the holder (the
lender/creditor) to put it back to the issuer (ie to demand repayment)
before maturity are not contingent on future events other than to
protect:
(i)
the holder against a change in the credit risk of the issuer or
the instrument (for example, defaults, credit downgrades or
loan covenant violations) or a change in control of the issuer;
or
(ii)
the holder or issuer against changes in relevant taxation or law.
(d)
there are no conditional returns or repayment provisions except for
the variable rate return described in (a) and prepayment provisions
described in (c).
A debt instrument that does not meet all of the conditions in
paragraph 11.9(a)–(d) shall nevertheless be accounted for in accordance with
Part I of Section  11 if the contractual terms of the instrument give rise on
specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest
on the outstanding principal amount. A debt instrument with contractual
terms that introduce exposure to unrelated risks or volatility—for example,
changes in equity prices or commodity prices—is unlikely to meet this
requirement. For the purpose of the requirement in this paragraph, ‘interest’
includes reasonable compensation for the time value of money, credit risk and
other basic lending risks and costs—for example, liquidity risk, administrative
costs associated with holding the instrument and lender’s profit margin—
consistent with a basic lending arrangement.
Examples of debt instruments that would normally satisfy the conditions in
paragraph 11.9(a)(iv) include:
(a)
a bank loan that has a fixed interest rate for an initial period that then
reverts to a quoted or observable variable interest rate after that
period; and
(b)
a bank loan with interest payable at a quoted or observable variable
interest rate plus a fixed rate throughout the life of the loan, for
example SONIA plus 200 basis points.
An example of a debt instrument that would normally satisfy the conditions
set out in paragraph 11.9(b)–(c) would be a bank loan that permits the
borrower to terminate the arrangement early, even though the borrower may
be required to pay a penalty to compensate the bank for its costs of the
borrower terminating the arrangement early.
11.9ZA
11.9A
11.9B
IFRS FOR SMES ACCOUNTING STANDARD
© IFRS Foundation
85
 Other examples of financial instruments that would normally satisfy the
conditions in paragraph 11.9 are:
(a)
trade accounts and notes receivable and payable, and loans from banks
or other third parties.
(b)
accounts payable in a foreign currency. However, any change in the
account payable because of a change in the exchange rate is recognised
in profit or loss as required by paragraph 30.10.
(c)
loans to or from subsidiaries or associates that are due on demand.
(d)
a debt instrument that would become immediately receivable if the
issuer defaults on an interest or principal payment (such a provision
does not violate the conditions in paragraph 11.9).
Examples of financial instruments that do not satisfy the conditions in
paragraph 11.9 or 11.9ZA (and are therefore within the scope of Part II of
Section 11) include:
(a)
an investment in another entity’s equity instruments other than
non-convertible preference shares and non-puttable ordinary and
preference shares (see paragraph 11.8(d));
(b)
an interest rate swap that returns a cash flow that is positive or
negative, or a forward commitment to purchase a commodity or
financial instrument that is capable of being cash-settled and that, on
settlement, could have positive or negative cash flow, because such
swaps and forwards do not meet the condition in paragraph 11.9(a);
(c)
options and forward contracts, because returns to the holder are not
fixed and the condition in paragraph 11.9(a) is not met; and
(d)
investments in convertible debt, because the return to the holder can
vary with the price of the issuer’s equity shares instead of just with
market interest rates.
An entity shall not reassess the classification of a financial instrument after
initial recognition.
Initial recognition of financial assets and liabilities
An entity shall recognise a financial asset or a financial liability only when the
entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Initial measurement
When a financial asset or financial liability is recognised initially, an entity
shall measure it at the transaction price (including transaction costs except in
the initial measurement of financial assets and liabilities that are
subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss) unless:
(a)
the financial asset is a trade receivable (see paragraph 11.13A); or
11.10
11.11
11.11A
11.12
11.13
FEBRUARY 2025

© IFRS Foundation
 (b)
the arrangement constitutes, in effect, a financing transaction for
either the entity (for a financial liability) or the counterparty (for a
financial asset) to the arrangement (see paragraph 11.13B).
A trade receivable shall be recognised initially at the amount determined by
applying Section 23, unless the arrangement constitutes, in effect, a financing
transaction and the entity does not apply the option in paragraph 23.38. For
such arrangements, the entity shall measure the trade receivable in
accordance with paragraph 11.13B.
An arrangement constitutes a financing transaction if payment is deferred
beyond normal business terms, for example, providing interest-free credit to a
buyer for the sale of goods, or is financed at a rate of interest that is not a
market rate, for example, an interest-free or below market interest rate loan
made to an employee. If the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction,
the entity shall measure the financial asset or financial liability at the present
value of the future payments discounted at a market rate of interest for a
similar debt instrument as determined at initial recognition.
Examples—financial assets
1
For a long-term loan made to another entity, a receivable is
recognised at the present value of cash receivable (including interest
payments and repayment of principal) from that entity.
2
For goods sold to a customer on short-term credit, a receivable is
recognised at the amount determined by applying Section 23, which
is normally the invoice price.
3
For an item sold to a customer on two-year interest-free credit, a
receivable is recognised at the present value of the cash receivable
discounted using the prevailing market rate(s) of interest for a
similar receivable. The current cash sale price will normally
approximate the present value of the cash receivable discounted at
the appropriate market rate.
4
For a cash purchase of another entity’s ordinary shares, the
investment is recognised at the amount of cash paid to acquire the
shares.
Examples—financial liabilities
1
For a loan received from a bank, a payable is recognised initially at
the present value of cash payable to the bank (for example, including
interest payments and repayment of principal).
2
For goods purchased from a supplier on short-term credit, a payable
is recognised at the undiscounted amount owed to the supplier,
which is normally the invoice price.

 Subsequent measurement
At the end of each reporting period, an entity shall measure financial
instruments as follows, without any deduction for transaction costs the entity
may incur on sale or other disposal:
(a)
debt instruments that meet the conditions in paragraph 11.8(b) shall
be measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Paragraphs 11.15–11.20 provide guidance on determining amortised
cost using the effective interest method. Debt instruments that are
classified as current assets or current liabilities shall be measured at
the undiscounted amount of the cash or other consideration expected
to be paid or received (ie net of impairment—see paragraphs
11.21–11.26) unless the arrangement constitutes, in effect, a financing
transaction (see paragraphs 11.13 and 11.13B). Trade receivables that
are classified as current assets shall be measured at the undiscounted
amount of the cash or other consideration expected to be received (ie
net of impairment) unless the arrangement constitutes, in effect, a
financing transaction and the entity does not apply the option in
paragraph 23.38.
(b)
commitments to receive a loan that meet the conditions in
paragraph 11.8(c) shall be measured at cost (which sometimes is nil)
less impairment.
(c)
investments in non-convertible preference shares and non-puttable
ordinary or preference shares shall be measured as follows (Section 12
provides guidance on fair value):
(i)
if the shares are publicly traded or their fair value can
otherwise be measured reliably without undue cost or effort,
the investment shall be measured at fair value with changes in
fair value recognised in profit or loss; and
(ii)
all other such investments shall be measured at cost less
impairment.
Impairment or uncollectability must be assessed for financial assets in (a), (b)
and (c)(ii). Paragraphs 11.21–11.26 provide guidance.
Dividends are recognised in profit or loss only when:
(a)
the entity’s right to receive payment is established;
(b)
it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the dividend
will flow to the entity; and
(c)
the amount of the dividend can be measured reliably.
Amortised cost and effective interest method
The amortised cost of a financial asset or financial liability at each
reporting date is the net of the following amounts:
11.14
11.14A
11.15
FEBRUARY 2025
88
© IFRS Foundation
 (a)
the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is
measured at initial recognition;
(b)
minus any repayments of the principal;
(c)
plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest
method of any difference between the amount at initial recognition
and the maturity amount;
(d)
minus, in the case of a financial asset, any reduction (directly or
through the use of an allowance account) for impairment or
uncollectability.
Financial assets and financial liabilities that have no stated interest rate, that
do not relate to an arrangement that constitutes a financing transaction and
that are classified as current assets or current liabilities are initially measured
at an undiscounted amount in accordance with paragraph 11.13.
Consequently, (c) does not apply to them.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of
a financial asset or a financial liability (or a group of financial assets or
financial liabilities) and of allocating the interest income or interest expense
over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly
discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected
life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period, to the
carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability. The effective
interest rate is determined on the basis of the carrying amount of the
financial asset or liability at initial recognition. Under the effective interest
method:
(a)
the amortised cost of a financial asset (liability) is the present value of
future cash receipts (payments) discounted at the effective interest
rate; and
(b)
the interest expense (income) in a period equals the carrying amount
of the financial liability (asset) at the beginning of a period multiplied
by the effective interest rate for the period.
When calculating the effective interest rate, an entity shall estimate cash
flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument (for
example prepayment, call and similar options) and known credit losses that
have been incurred, but it shall not consider possible future credit losses not
yet incurred.
When calculating the effective interest rate, an entity shall amortise any
related fees, finance charges paid or received (such as ‘points’), transaction
costs and other premiums or discounts over the expected life of the
instrument, except as follows. The entity shall use a shorter period if that is
the period to which the fees, finance charges paid or received, transaction
costs, premiums or discounts relate. This will be the case when the variable to
which the fees, finance charges paid or received, transaction costs, premiums
or discounts relate is repriced to market rates before the expected maturity of
11.16
11.17
11.18
IFRS FOR SMES ACCOUNTING STANDARD
© IFRS Foundation
89
 the instrument. In such a case, the appropriate amortisation period is the
period to the next such repricing date.
For variable rate financial assets and variable rate financial liabilities, periodic
re-estimation of cash flows to reflect changes in market rates of interest alters
the effective interest rate. If a variable rate financial asset or variable rate
financial liability is recognised initially at an amount equal to the principal
receivable or payable at maturity, re-estimating the future interest payments
normally has no significant effect on the carrying amount of the asset or
liability.
If an entity revises its estimates of payments or receipts, the entity shall adjust
the carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability (or group of
financial instruments) to reflect actual and revised estimated cash flows. The
entity shall recalculate the carrying amount by computing the present value
of estimated future cash flows at the financial instrument’s original effective
interest rate. The entity shall recognise the adjustment as income or expense
in profit or loss at the date of the revision.
Example of determining amortised cost for a five-year loan using the
effective interest method
On 1 January 20X0, an entity acquires a bond for CU900, incurring
transaction costs of CU50.(a) Interest of CU40 is receivable annually, in
arrears, over the next five years (31 December 20X0–31 December 20X4). 
The bond has a mandatory redemption of CU1100 on 31 December 20X4.

 Impairment of financial assets measured at cost or
amortised cost
Recognition
At the end of each reporting period, an entity shall assess whether there is
objective evidence of impairment of any financial assets that are measured at
cost or amortised cost. If there is objective evidence of impairment, the entity
shall recognise an impairment loss in profit or loss immediately.
Objective evidence that a financial asset or group of assets is impaired includes
observable data that come to the attention of the holder of the asset about the
following loss events:
(a)
significant financial difficulty of the issuer or obligor;
(b)
a breach of contract, such as a default or delinquency in interest or
principal payments;
(c)
the creditor, for economic or legal reasons relating to the debtor’s
financial difficulty, granting to the debtor a concession that the
creditor would not otherwise consider;
(d)
it has become probable that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or other
financial reorganisation; or
(e)
observable data indicating that there has been a measurable decrease
in the estimated future cash flows from a group of financial assets
since the initial recognition of those assets, even though the decrease
cannot yet be identified with the individual financial assets in the
group, such as adverse national or local economic conditions or
adverse changes in industry conditions.
Other factors may also be evidence of impairment, including significant
changes with an adverse effect that have taken place in the technological,
market, economic or legal environment in which the debtor or issuer
operates.
An entity shall assess the following financial assets individually for
impairment:
(a)
all equity instruments regardless of significance; and
(b)
other financial assets that are individually significant.
An entity shall assess other financial assets for impairment either individually
or grouped on the basis of similar credit risk characteristics.
Measurement
An entity shall measure an impairment loss on the following financial assets
measured at cost or amortised cost as follows:
11.21
11.22
11.23
11.24
11.25
IFRS FOR SMES ACCOUNTING STANDARD
© IFRS Foundation
91
 (a)
for a financial asset measured at amortised cost in accordance with
paragraph 11.14(a), the impairment loss is the difference between the
asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated cash flows
discounted at the asset’s original effective interest rate. If such a
financial asset has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for
measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate
determined under the contract.
(b)
for a financial asset measured at cost less impairment in accordance
with paragraphs 11.14(b) and 11.14(c)(ii) the impairment loss is the
difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the best estimate
(which will necessarily be an approximation) of the amount (which
might be zero) that the entity would receive for the asset if it were to
be sold at the reporting date.
Reversal
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of an impairment loss decreases and
the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the
impairment was recognised (such as an improvement in the debtor’s credit
rating), the entity shall reverse the previously recognised impairment loss
either directly or by adjusting an allowance account. The reversal shall not
result in a carrying amount of the financial asset (net of any allowance
account) that exceeds what the carrying amount would have been had the
impairment not previously been recognised. The entity shall recognise the
amount of the reversal in profit or loss immediately.

Derecognition of a financial asset
An entity shall derecognise a financial asset only when either:
(a)
the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire
or are settled;
(b)
the entity transfers to another party substantially all of the risks and
rewards of ownership of the financial asset; or
(c)
the entity, despite having retained some significant risks and rewards
of ownership, has transferred control of the asset to another party and
the other party has the practical ability to sell the asset in its entirety
to an unrelated third party and is able to exercise that ability
unilaterally and without needing to impose additional restrictions on
the transfer—in this case, the entity shall:

 (i)
derecognise the asset; and
(ii)
recognise separately any rights and obligations retained or
created in the transfer.
The carrying amount of the transferred asset shall be allocated
between the rights or obligations retained and those transferred on the
basis of their relative fair values at the transfer date. Newly created
rights and obligations shall be measured at their fair values at that
date. Any difference between the consideration received and the
amounts recognised and derecognised in accordance with this
paragraph shall be recognised in profit or loss in the period of the
transfer.
If a transfer does not result in derecognition because the entity has retained
significant risks and rewards of ownership of the transferred asset, the entity
shall continue to recognise the transferred asset in its entirety and shall
recognise a financial liability for the consideration received. The asset and
liability shall not be offset. In subsequent periods, the entity shall recognise
any income on the transferred asset and any expense incurred on the financial
liability.
If a transferor provides non-cash collateral (such as debt or equity
instruments) to the transferee, the accounting for the collateral by the
transferor and the transferee depends on whether the transferee has the right
to sell or repledge the collateral and on whether the transferor has defaulted.
The transferor and transferee shall account for the collateral as follows:
(a)
if the transferee has the right by contract or custom to sell or repledge
the collateral, the transferor shall reclassify that asset in its statement
of financial position (for example, as a loaned asset, pledged equity
instruments or repurchase receivable) separately from other assets;
(b)
if the transferee sells collateral pledged to it, it shall recognise the
proceeds from the sale and a liability measured at fair value for its
obligation to return the collateral;
(c)
if the transferor defaults under the terms of the contract and is no
longer entitled to redeem the collateral, it shall derecognise the
collateral and the transferee shall recognise the collateral as its asset
initially measured at fair value or, if it has already sold the collateral,
derecognise its obligation to return the collateral; and
(d)
except as provided in (c), the transferor shall continue to carry the
collateral as its asset and the transferee shall not recognise the
collateral as an asset.

 Example—transfer that qualifies for derecognition
An entity sells a group of its accounts receivable to a bank at less than their
face amount. The entity continues to handle collections from the debtors on
behalf of the bank, including sending monthly statements, and the bank
pays the entity a market-rate fee for servicing the receivables. The entity is
obliged to remit promptly to the bank any and all amounts collected, but it
has no obligation to the bank for slow payment or non-payment by the
debtors. In this case, the entity has transferred to the bank substantially all
of the risks and rewards of ownership of the receivables. Accordingly, it
removes the receivables from its statement of financial position (ie
derecognises them) and it shows no liability in respect of the proceeds
received from the bank. The entity recognises a loss calculated as the
difference between the carrying amount of the receivables at the time of sale
and the proceeds received from the bank. The entity recognises a liability to
the extent that it has collected funds from the debtors but has not yet
remitted them to the bank.
Example—transfer that does not qualify for derecognition
The facts are the same as the preceding example except that the entity has
agreed to buy back from the bank any receivables for which the debtor is in
arrears as to principal or interest for more than 120 days. In this case, the
entity has retained the risk of slow payment or non-payment by the debtors
—a significant risk with respect to receivables. Accordingly, the entity does
not treat the receivables as having been sold to the bank, and it does not
derecognise them. Instead, it treats the proceeds from the bank as a loan
secured by the receivables. The entity continues to recognise the receivables
as an asset until they are collected or written off as uncollectable.
Derecognition of a financial liability
An entity shall derecognise a financial liability (or a part of a financial
liability) only when it is extinguished—ie when the obligation specified in the
contract is discharged, is cancelled or expires.
If an existing borrower and lender exchange financial instruments with
substantially different terms, the entities shall account for the transaction as
an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a
new financial liability. Similarly, an entity shall account for a substantial
modification of the terms of an existing financial liability or a part of it
(whether or not attributable to the financial difficulty of the debtor) as an
extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new
financial liability.
The entity shall recognise in profit or loss any difference between the carrying
amount of the financial liability (or part of a financial liability) extinguished
or transferred to another party and the consideration paid, including any
non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed.

 Disclosures
The following disclosures make reference to disclosures for financial liabilities
measured at fair value through profit or loss. Entities that have only basic
financial instruments (and therefore do not apply Part II of Section 11) will not
have any financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss and
hence will not need to provide such disclosures.
Disclosure of accounting policies for financial
instruments
In accordance with paragraph 8.5, an entity shall disclose material accounting
policy information. Information about the measurement basis (or bases) for
financial instruments used in preparing the financial statements is expected
to be material accounting policy information.
Statement of financial position—categories of financial
assets and financial liabilities
An entity shall disclose the carrying amounts of each of the following
categories of financial assets and financial liabilities at the reporting date, in
total, either in the statement of financial position or in the notes:
(a)
financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss
(paragraph 11.14(c)(i) and paragraph 11.54);
(b)
financial assets that are debt instruments measured at amortised cost
(paragraph 11.14(a));
(c)
financial assets that are equity instruments measured at cost less
impairment (paragraph 11.14(c)(ii) and paragraph 11.54);
(d)
financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss
(paragraph 11.54);
(e)
financial liabilities measured at amortised cost (paragraph 11.14(a));
and
(f)
loan 
commitments 
measured 
at 
cost 
less 
impairment
(paragraph 11.14(b)).
An entity shall disclose information that enables users of its financial
statements to evaluate the significance of financial instruments for its
financial position and performance. For example, for long-term debt such
information would normally include the terms and conditions of the debt
instrument (such as interest rate, maturity, repayment schedule, and
restrictions that the debt instrument imposes on the entity).
An entity shall disclose an analysis of the age, by reference to due date, of
trade receivables and other financial assets measured at amortised cost at the
reporting date, showing separately:
11.39
11.40
11.41
11.42

 (a)
the amortised cost of the financial assets before adjusting for any
reduction (directly or by using an allowance account) for impairment
or uncollectability (see paragraph 11.15(d)); and
(b)
any reduction (directly or by using an allowance account) for
impairment or uncollectability (see paragraph 11.15(d)).
An entity shall disclose a maturity analysis for financial liabilities by category
(see paragraph 11.41(d)–(e)). The maturity analysis shall include the remaining
contractual maturities. The contractual amounts disclosed in the maturity
analysis are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.
In preparing the disclosures in paragraphs 11.43–11.43A, an entity shall use
time bands it considers to be the most useful. For example, for
paragraph 11.43 the time bands might be:
(a)
not later than one month;
(b)
later than one month and not later than three months;
(c)
later than three months and not later than one year;
(d)
later than one year and not later than five years; and
(e)
later than five years.
If a reliable measure of fair value is no longer available, or is not available
without undue cost or effort when such an exemption is provided, for any
financial instruments that would otherwise be required to be measured at fair
value through profit or loss in accordance with this Standard, the entity shall
disclose that fact, the carrying amount of those financial instruments and, if
an undue cost or effort exemption has been used, the reasons why a reliable
fair value measurement would involve undue cost or effort.
Transferred financial assets that do not qualify for
derecognition
If an entity has transferred financial assets to another party in a transaction
that does not qualify for derecognition (see paragraphs 11.33–11.35), the
entity shall disclose the following for each class of such financial assets:
(a)
the nature of the assets;
(b)
the nature of the risks and rewards of ownership to which the entity
remains exposed; and
(c)
the carrying amounts of the assets and of any associated liabilities that
the entity continues to recognise.
Collateral
When an entity has pledged financial assets as collateral for liabilities or
contingent liabilities, it shall disclose the following:
(a)
the carrying amount of the financial assets pledged as collateral; and
(b)
the terms and conditions relating to its pledge.

 Defaults and breaches on loans payable
For loans payable recognised at the reporting date for which there is a breach
of terms or a default of principal, interest, sinking fund or redemption terms
that have not been remedied by the reporting date, an entity shall disclose the
following:
(a)
details of that breach or default;
(b)
the carrying amount of the related loans payable at the reporting date;
and
(c)
whether the breach or default was remedied, or the terms of the loans
payable were renegotiated, before the financial statements were
authorised for issue.
Items of income, expense, gains or losses
An entity shall disclose the following items of income, expense, gains or
losses:
(a)
income, expense, gains or losses, including changes in fair value,
recognised on:
(i)
financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss;
(ii)
financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or
loss;
(iii)
financial assets measured at amortised cost; and
(iv)
financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.
(b)
total interest income and total interest expense (calculated using the
effective interest method) for financial assets or financial liabilities
that are not measured at fair value through profit or loss; and
(c)
the amount of any impairment loss for each class of financial asset.

 Part II of Section  11
Other Financial Instrument Issues
Scope of Part II of Section 11
Part II of Section 11 applies to all financial instruments except the following:
(a)
those covered by Part I of Section 11.
(b)
investments in subsidiaries and associates and joint arrangements
that are accounted for in accordance with Section 9 Consolidated and
Separate Financial Statements, Section 14 Investments in Associates or
Section 15 Joint Arrangements.
(c)
employers’ rights and obligations under employee benefit plans (see
Section 28 Employee Benefits).
(d)
rights under insurance contracts unless the insurance contract could
result in a loss to either party as a result of contractual terms that are
unrelated to:
(i)
changes in the insured risk;
(ii)
changes in foreign exchange rates; or
(iii)
a default by one of the counterparties.
(e)
financial instruments that meet the definition of an entity’s own
equity, including the equity component of compound financial
instruments issued by the entity (see Section 22 Liabilities and Equity).
(f)
leases within the scope of Section 20 Leases. Consequently, Part II of
Section 11 applies to leases that could result in a loss to the lessor or
the lessee as a result of contractual terms that are unrelated to:
(i)
changes in the price of the leased asset;
(ii)
changes in foreign exchange rates;
(iii)
changes in lease payments based on variable market interest
rates; or
(iv)
a default by one of the counterparties.
(g)
the measurement requirements do not apply to contracts for
contingent consideration in a business combination (see Section 19
Business Combinations and Goodwill) whose fair value cannot be measured
reliably without undue cost or effort at the acquisition date (see
paragraph 19.27).
(h)
financial instruments, contracts and obligations under share-based
payment transactions to which Section 26 Share-based Payment applies.
(i)
reimbursement assets that are accounted for in accordance with
Section 21 Provisions and Contingencies (see paragraph 21.9).
11.49
FEBRUARY 2025

© IFRS Foundation
 (j)
rights and obligations within the scope of Section 23 Revenue from
Contracts with Customers that are financial instruments, except for trade
receivables that are not accounted for in accordance with Part I of
Section 11.
(k)
financial guarantee contracts issued at nil consideration when the
specified 
debtor 
is 
another 
entity 
within 
the 
group 
(see
paragraph 21.1A). Part II of Section 11 applies to other issued financial
guarantee contracts.
Most contracts to buy or sell a non-financial item such as a commodity,
inventory or property, plant and equipment are excluded from this section
because they are not financial instruments. However, Part II of Section 11
applies to all contracts that impose risks on the buyer or seller that are not
typical of contracts to buy or sell non-financial items. For example, Part II of
Section 11 applies to contracts that could result in a loss to the buyer or seller
as a result of contractual terms that are unrelated to changes in the price of
the non-financial item, changes in foreign exchange rates or a default by one
of the counterparties.
In addition to the contracts described in paragraph 11.50, Part II of Section 11
applies to contracts to buy or sell non-financial items if the contract can be
settled net in cash or another financial instrument, or by exchanging financial
instruments as if the contracts were financial instruments, with the following
exception: contracts that were entered into and continue to be held for the
purpose of the receipt or delivery of a non-financial item in accordance with
the entity’s expected purchase, sale or usage requirements are not financial
instruments for the purposes of Section 11.
Initial recognition of financial assets and liabilities
An entity shall recognise a financial asset or a financial liability only when the
entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Initial measurement
When a financial asset or financial liability is recognised initially, an entity
shall measure it at its fair value, which is normally the transaction price.
Subsequent measurement
At the end of each reporting period, an entity shall measure all financial
instruments within the scope of Part II of Section 11 at fair value and
recognise changes in fair value in profit or loss, except as follows:
(a)
some changes in the fair value of hedging instruments in a designated
hedging relationship are required to be recognised in other
comprehensive income by paragraph 11.69; and

 (b)
equity instruments that are not publicly traded and whose fair value
cannot otherwise be measured reliably without undue cost or effort
and contracts linked to such instruments that, if exercised, will result
in delivery of such instruments, shall be measured at cost less
impairment.
Dividends are recognised in profit or loss only when:
(a)
the entity’s right to receive payment is established;
(b)
it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the dividend
will flow to the entity; and
(c)
the amount of the dividend can be measured reliably.
If a reliable measure of fair value is no longer available without undue cost or
effort for an equity instrument, or a contract linked to such an instrument
that if exercised will result in the delivery of such instruments, that is not
publicly traded but is measured at fair value through profit or loss, its fair
value at the last date that the instrument was reliably measurable without
undue cost or effort is treated as the cost of the instrument. The entity shall
measure the instrument at this cost amount less impairment until it is able to
determine a reliable measure of fair value without undue cost or effort.
Fair value
An entity shall apply the guidance on fair value in Section 12 to fair value
measurements in accordance with Section 11.
The fair value of a financial liability that is due on demand is not less than the
amount payable on demand, discounted from the first date that the amount
could be required to be paid.
Impairment of financial assets measured at cost or amortised
cost
An entity shall apply the guidance on impairment in paragraphs 11.21–11.26
to financial assets measured at cost less impairment in accordance with Part II
of Section 11.
Derecognition of a financial asset or financial liability
An entity shall apply the derecognition requirements in paragraphs
11.33–11.38 to financial assets and financial liabilities to which Section 11
applies.

 Hedge accounting
If specified criteria are met, an entity may designate a hedging relationship
between a hedging instrument and a hedged item in such a way as to qualify
for hedge accounting. Hedge accounting permits the gain or loss on the
hedging instrument and on the hedged item to be recognised in profit or loss
at the same time.
To qualify for hedge accounting, an entity shall comply with all of the
following conditions:
(a)
the entity designates and documents the hedging relationship so that
the risk being hedged, the hedged item and the hedging instrument
are clearly identified and the risk in the hedged item is the risk being
hedged with the hedging instrument.
(b)
the hedged risk is one of the risks specified in paragraph 11.63.
(c)
the hedging instrument is as specified in paragraph 11.64.
(d)
the entity expects the hedging instrument to be highly effective in
offsetting the designated hedged risk. The effectiveness of a hedge is
the degree to which changes in the fair value or cash flows of the
hedged item that are attributable to the hedged risk are offset by
changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedging instrument.
This Standard permits hedge accounting only for the following risks:
(a)
interest rate risk of a debt instrument measured at amortised cost;
(b)
foreign exchange or interest rate risk in a firm commitment or a
highly probable forecast transaction;
(c)
price risk of a commodity that an entity holds or in a firm
commitment or highly probable forecast transaction to purchase or
sell a commodity; and
(d)
foreign exchange risk in a net investment in a foreign operation.
Foreign exchange risk of a debt instrument measured at amortised cost is not
in the list because hedge accounting would not have any significant effect on
the financial statements. Basic accounts, notes and loans receivable and
payable are normally measured at amortised cost (see paragraph 11.5(d)). This
would include payables denominated in a foreign currency. Paragraph 30.10
requires any change in the carrying amount of the payable because of a
change in the exchange rate to be recognised in profit or loss. Consequently,
both the change in fair value of the hedging instrument (the cross-currency
swap) and the change in the carrying amount of the payable relating to the
change in the exchange rate would be recognised in profit or loss and should
offset each other except to the extent of the difference between the spot rate
(at which the liability is measured) and the forward rate (at which the swap is
measured).
11.61
11.62
11.63
IFRS FOR SMES ACCOUNTING STANDARD
© IFRS Foundation
101
 This Standard permits hedge accounting only if the hedging instrument has
all of the following terms and conditions:
(a)
it is an interest rate swap, a foreign currency swap, a foreign currency
forward exchange contract or a commodity forward exchange contract
that is expected to be highly effective in offsetting a risk identified in
paragraph 11.63 that is designated as the hedged risk;
(b)
it involves a party external to the reporting entity (ie external to the
group or individual entity being reported on);
(c)
its notional amount is equal to the designated amount of the principal
or notional amount of the hedged item;
(d)
it has a specified maturity date not later than:
(i)
the maturity of the financial instrument being hedged;
(ii)
the expected settlement of the commodity purchase or sale
commitment; or
(iii)
the occurrence of the highly probable forecast foreign currency
or commodity transaction being hedged.
(e)
it has no prepayment, early termination or extension features.
Hedge of fixed interest rate risk of a recognised financial
instrument or commodity price risk of a commodity held
If the conditions in paragraph 11.62 are met and the hedged risk is the
exposure to a fixed interest rate risk of a debt instrument measured at
amortised cost or the commodity price risk of a commodity that it holds, the
entity shall:
(a)
recognise the hedging instrument as an asset or liability and the
change in the fair value of the hedging instrument in profit or loss;
and
(b)
recognise the change in the fair value of the hedged item related to the
hedged risk in profit or loss and as an adjustment to the carrying
amount of the hedged item.
If the hedged risk is the fixed interest rate risk of a debt instrument measured
at amortised cost, the entity shall recognise the periodic net cash settlements
on the interest rate swap that is the hedging instrument in profit or loss in the
period in which the net settlements accrue.
The 
entity 
shall 
discontinue 
the 
hedge 
accounting 
specified 
in
paragraph 11.65 if:
(a)
the hedging instrument expires or is sold or terminated;
(b)
the hedge no longer meets the conditions for hedge accounting
specified in paragraph 11.62; or
(c)
the entity revokes the designation.

 If hedge accounting is discontinued and the hedged item is an asset or liability
carried at amortised cost that has not been derecognised, any gains or losses
recognised as adjustments to the carrying amount of the hedged item are
amortised into profit or loss using the effective interest method over the
remaining life of the hedged item.
Hedge of variable interest rate risk of a recognised
financial instrument, foreign exchange risk or commodity
price risk in a firm commitment or highly probable
forecast transaction or a net investment in a foreign
operation
If the conditions in paragraph 11.62 are met and the hedged risk is:
(a)
the variable interest rate risk in a debt instrument measured at
amortised cost;
(b)
the foreign exchange risk in a firm commitment or a highly probable
forecast transaction;
(c)
the commodity price risk in a firm commitment or highly probable
forecast transaction; or
(d)
the foreign exchange risk in a net investment in a foreign operation,
the entity shall recognise in other comprehensive income the portion of the
change in the fair value of the hedging instrument that was effective in
offsetting the change in the fair value or expected cash flows of the hedged
item. The entity shall recognise in profit or loss in each period any excess (in
absolute amount) of the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedging
instrument over the cumulative change in the fair value of the expected cash
flows of the hedged item since inception of the hedge (sometimes called hedge
ineffectiveness). The hedging gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive
income shall be reclassified to profit or loss when the hedged item is
recognised in profit or loss, subject to the requirements in paragraph 11.71.
However, the cumulative amount of any exchange differences that relate to a
hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation recognised in other
comprehensive income shall not be reclassified to profit or loss on disposal or
partial disposal of the foreign operation.
If the hedged risk is the variable interest rate risk in a debt instrument
measured at amortised cost, the entity shall subsequently recognise in profit
or loss the periodic net cash settlements from the interest rate swap that is
the hedging instrument in the period in which the net settlements accrue.
The entity shall discontinue prospectively the hedge accounting specified in
paragraph 11.69 if:
(a)
the hedging instrument expires or is sold or terminated;
(b)
the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting in
paragraph 11.62;

 (c)
in a hedge of a forecast transaction, the forecast transaction is no
longer highly probable; or
(d)
the entity revokes the designation.
If the forecast transaction is no longer expected to take place or if the hedged
debt instrument measured at amortised cost is derecognised, any gain or loss
on the hedging instrument that was recognised in other comprehensive
income shall be reclassified to profit or loss.
Disclosures
An entity applying Part II of Section 11 shall make all of the disclosures
required in Part I of Section 11 incorporating in those disclosures financial
instruments that are within the scope of Part II of Section 11 as well as those
within the scope of Part I of Section 11. In addition, if the entity uses hedge
accounting, it shall make the additional disclosures in paragraphs
11.73–11.75.
An entity shall disclose the following separately for hedges of each of the four
types of risks described in paragraph 11.63:
(a)
a description of the hedge;
(b)
a description of the financial instruments designated as hedging
instruments and their fair values at the reporting date; and
(c)
the nature of the risks being hedged, including a description of the
hedged item.
If an entity uses hedge accounting for a hedge of fixed interest rate risk or
commodity price risk of a commodity held (paragraphs 11.65–11.68) it shall
disclose the following:
(a)
the amount of the change in fair value of the hedging instrument
recognised in profit or loss for the period; and
(b)
the amount of the change in fair value of the hedged item recognised
in profit or loss for the period.
If an entity uses hedge accounting for a hedge of variable interest rate risk,
foreign exchange risk, commodity price risk in a firm commitment or highly
probable forecast transaction or a net investment in a foreign operation
(paragraphs 11.69–11.71), it shall disclose the following:
(a)
the periods when the cash flows are expected to occur and when they
are expected to affect profit or loss;
(b)
a description of any forecast transaction for which hedge accounting
had previously been used, but which is no longer expected to occur;

 Section 12
Fair Value Measurement
Scope of this section
This section applies when another section requires or permits fair value
measurements or disclosures about fair value measurements, except:
(a)
share-based payment transactions within the scope of Section 26
Share-based Payment; and
(b)
leasing transactions within the scope of Section 20 Leases.
The disclosures required by this section are not required for:
(a)
plan assets measured at fair value in accordance with Section 28
Employee Benefits; and
(b)
assets for which the recoverable amount is fair value less costs of
disposal in accordance with Section 27 Impairment of Assets.
Measurement
Objective of fair value measurement
The objective of a fair value measurement is to estimate the price at which an
orderly transaction (not a forced transaction) to sell an asset or to transfer a
liability would take place between market participants at the measurement
date under current market conditions (an exit price at the measurement date).
Measurement principles
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to
transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at
the measurement date. Fair value is a market-based rather than entity-specific
measurement. An entity shall measure fair value using the same assumptions
that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. The
entity’s intention to hold the asset or settle the liability is not relevant.
An entity shall take into account the characteristics of the asset or liability
when measuring fair value if market participants would take those
characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at the
measurement date. Such characteristics include:
(a)
the condition and location of the asset; and
(b)
restrictions, if any, on the sale or use of the asset.
An entity shall assume that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the
liability takes place in either:
(a)
the principal market for the asset or liability; or
(b)
in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market
for the asset or liability.

© IFRS Foundation
 The entity must have access to the principal (or most advantageous) market at
the measurement date. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, an entity
shall assume the market in which the entity would normally enter into a
transaction to sell the asset or to transfer the liability is the principal market
or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market. Even
if no observable market exists, the entity shall assume that a transaction takes
place at the measurement date as a basis for estimating fair value.
An entity shall ignore transaction costs when using the price in the principal
(or most advantageous) market to measure the fair value of the asset or
liability. Transaction costs are not a characteristic of an asset or a liability;
instead, they are specific to a transaction.
If location is a characteristic of the asset, an entity shall adjust the price in the
principal (or most advantageous) market for the costs, if any, that would be
incurred to transport the asset from its current location to that market.
Highest and best use for non-financial assets
When making a fair value measurement of a non-financial asset, an entity
shall take into account a market participant’s ability to generate economic
benefits by using the asset for its highest and best use or by selling it to
another market participant that would use the asset for its highest and best
use.
The highest and best use of a non-financial asset takes into account any use of
the asset that is physically possible, legally allowed and financially feasible as
follows:
(a)
a use that is physically possible takes into account the physical
characteristics of the asset that market participants would take into
account when pricing the asset (for example, the location or size of a
property);
(b)
a use that is legally allowed takes into account any legal restrictions on
the use of the asset that market participants would take into account
when pricing the asset (for example, the zoning regulations applicable
to a property); and
(c)
a use that is financially feasible takes into account whether a use
generates adequate income or cash flows that market participants
would require from an investment in that asset put to that use.
An entity shall assume the current use of a non-financial asset is its highest
and best use unless market or other factors suggest that a different use by
market participants would maximise the value of the asset.
If a non-financial asset provides maximum value to market participants
through its use in combination with other assets (and liabilities), an entity
shall assume the asset would be used with those other assets (and liabilities)
and that those other assets (and liabilities) would be available to market
participants. An entity shall make consistent assumptions about the highest

107
 and best use of a non-financial asset for all the assets (for which highest and
best use is relevant) with which the asset would be used.
Valuation techniques
If a price for an identical asset or liability is not observable, an entity shall
measure fair value using another valuation technique. The entity shall use a
valuation technique that is appropriate in the circumstances and for which
sufficient data is available to measure fair value. The entity shall maximise its
use of relevant observable inputs and minimise its use of unobservable
inputs.
Three widely used valuation approaches are the market approach, the cost
approach and the income approach. An entity shall use a valuation technique
consistent with one or more of these approaches:
(a)
the market approach uses as inputs the prices and other relevant
information generated by market transactions involving identical or
similar assets, liabilities or a group of assets and liabilities, such as a
business. For example, valuation techniques consistent with the
market approach often use market multiples derived from a set of
comparables.
(b)
the cost approach calculates the amount that would be required
currently to replace the service capacity of an asset (often called
‘current replacement cost’).
(c)
the income approach converts future amounts (for example, cash flows or
income and expenses) to a single current (that is, discounted) amount.
Valuation techniques using the income approach include:
(i)
present value techniques;
(ii)
option pricing models; and
(iii)
the multi-period excess earnings method, which is used to
measure the fair value of some intangible assets.
An entity shall account for revisions resulting from a change in the valuation
technique or a change in its application as a change in accounting estimate in
Section 10. However, an entity is not required to apply the disclosure
requirements in Section 10 for a change in accounting estimate resulting from
a change in a valuation technique or its application.
An asset or a liability measured at fair value might have a bid price and an ask
price (for example, an input from a dealer market). If so, an entity shall
measure the fair value of the asset or liability using the price within the
bid–ask spread that is most representative of fair value in the circumstances.
The entity shall use this price to measure fair value regardless of how the
entity categorises the input within the fair value hierarchy (that is Level 1,
Level 2 or Level 3; see paragraphs 12.22–12.27). The entity is permitted, but
not required, to use the bid prices for asset positions and ask prices for
liability positions. This section does not preclude an entity from using
mid-market pricing or other pricing conventions, within a bid–ask spread,
12.14
12.15
12.16
12.17
FEBRUARY 2025

© IFRS Foundation
 that are used by market participants as a practical expedient for fair value
measurements.
Reliable measure of fair value
A valuation technique would be expected to arrive at a reliable measure of
fair value if:
(a)
the technique reasonably reflects how the market could be expected to
price the asset; and
(b)
the technique’s inputs reasonably represent market expectations and
measures of the risk return factors inherent in the asset.
The fair value of investments in assets that do not have a quoted market price
in an active market is reliably measurable if:
(a)
the variability in the range of reasonable fair value measures is not
significant for that asset; or
(b)
the probabilities of the various measures within the range can be
reasonably assessed and used to estimate fair value.
The variability in the range of reasonable fair value measures of assets that do
not have a quoted market price is likely not to be significant in many
situations. Normally an entity can estimate the fair value of an asset acquired
from an outside party. However, if the range of reasonable fair value measures
is significant and the probabilities of the various measures cannot be
reasonably assessed, then a reliable measure of fair value is not available.
If a reliable measure of fair value is no longer available for an asset measured
at fair value (or is not available without undue cost or effort when an undue
cost or effort exemption is provided—for example, see paragraphs 11.14(c) and
11.54(b)), an entity shall instead use its carrying amount at the last date the
asset was reliably measurable as its new cost. An entity shall measure the
asset at this cost amount less impairment until a reliable measure of fair
value is available (or is available without undue cost or effort when such an
exemption is provided).
Fair value hierarchy
For consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related
disclosures, an entity shall apply a fair value hierarchy, categorising the
inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels—
Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3. This fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority
to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
(Level 1 inputs) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs).
In some cases, an entity might categorise the inputs used to measure the fair
value of an asset or a liability within different levels of the fair value
hierarchy. In these cases, an entity shall categorise the entire fair value
measurement at the level of the lowest level input that is significant to the
entire measurement.

12.19
12.20
12.21
12.22
IFRS FOR SMES ACCOUNTING STANDARD
© IFRS Foundation
109
 Level 1 inputs
Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical
assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date. A
quoted price in an active market provides the most reliable evidence of fair
value. An entity shall use a quoted price in an active market to measure fair
value whenever such a price is available.
If an entity holds a position in a single asset or liability (including a position
comprising many identical assets or liabilities, such as a holding of financial
instruments) and the asset or liability is traded in an active market, the entity
shall measure the fair value of the asset or liability by multiplying the quoted
price for the individual asset or liability by the quantity it holds. The fair value
measurement of the asset or liability would be categorised within Level 1.
Level 2 inputs
Level 2 inputs are directly or indirectly observable inputs—other than quoted
prices included within Level 1—for the asset or liability. Level 2 inputs
include:
(a)
quoted prices in active markets for assets or liabilities that are similar
to the asset or liability.
(b)
quoted prices in markets that are not active for assets or liabilities that
are similar or identical to the asset or liability.
(c)
observable inputs other than quoted prices for the asset or liability—
for example:
(i)
interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted
intervals;
(ii)
implied volatilities; and
(iii)
credit spreads.
(d)
market-corroborated inputs.
If an entity adjusts a Level 2 input in a way that is significant to the entire
measurement and uses significant unobservable inputs, the entity might need
to categorise the fair value measurement within Level 3 of the fair value
hierarchy.
Level 3 inputs
Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. An entity shall
develop unobservable inputs using the best information available in the
circumstances, which might include the entity’s own data. In developing
unobservable inputs, an entity is permitted to begin with its own data, but the
entity shall adjust this data if reasonably available information indicates that
other market participants would use different data or there is something
particular to the entity that is not available to other market participants (for
example, an entity-specific synergy). An entity need not make exhaustive
efforts to obtain information about market participant assumptions. However,
12.23
12.24
12.25
12.26
12.27
FEBRUARY 2025
110
© IFRS Foundation
 an entity shall take into account all information about market participant
assumptions that is reasonably available.
Disclosures
An entity shall disclose for each class of assets and liabilities measured at fair
value in the statement of financial position after initial recognition:
(a)
the carrying amounts at the end of the reporting period;
(b)
the level of the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value
measurements are categorised in their entirety (Level 1, Level 2 or
Level 3); and
(c)
a description of the valuation technique(s) the entity used for fair value
measurements categorised within Level 2 and Level 3 of the fair value
hierarchy, and the inputs used in the fair value measurement.
For recurring fair value measurements categorised within Level 3 of the fair
value hierarchy, an entity shall disclose total gains or losses for the period
recognised in:
(a)
profit or loss, and the line items in profit or loss in which those gains
or losses are recognised; and
(b)
other comprehensive income, and the line items in other
comprehensive income in which those gains or losses are recognised.
An entity shall determine appropriate classes of assets and liabilities on the
basis of:
(a)
the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability; and
(b)
the level of the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value
measurement is categorised.
A class of assets and liabilities will often require greater disaggregation than
the line items presented in the statement of financial position; however, an
entity shall disclose sufficient information to permit reconciliation to the line
items presented in the statement of financial position.
An entity shall present the quantitative disclosures required by paragraphs
12.28–12.31 in a table unless another format would be more useful.

 Section 13
Inventories
Scope of this section
This section sets out the principles for recognising and measuring inventories.
Inventories are assets:
(a)
held for sale in the ordinary course of business;
(b)
in the process of production for such sale; or
(c)
in the form of materials or supplies to be consumed in the production
process or in the rendering of services.
This section applies to all inventories, except:
(a)
[deleted]
(b)
financial instruments (see Section 11 Financial Instruments); and
(c)
biological assets related to agricultural activity and agricultural
produce at the point of harvest (see Section 34 Specialised Activities).
The disclosure requirements in this section apply to returns assets classified as
inventory (see paragraph 23A.24(c)). Returns assets are recognised and
measured in accordance with paragraphs 23A.23–23A.27 and not in
accordance with this section.
This section does not apply to the measurement of inventories held by:
(a)
producers of agricultural and forest products, agricultural produce
after harvest, and minerals and mineral products, to the extent that
they are measured at fair value less costs to sell through profit or loss;
or
(b)
commodity brokers and dealers that measure their inventories at fair
value less costs to sell through profit or loss.
Measurement of inventories
An entity shall measure inventories at the lower of cost and estimated selling
price less costs to complete and sell.
Cost of inventories
An entity shall include in the cost of inventories all costs of purchase, costs of
conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their
present location and condition.

13.2A

 Costs of purchase
The costs of purchase of inventories comprise the purchase price, import
duties and other taxes (other than those subsequently recoverable by the
entity from the taxing authorities) and transport, handling and other costs
directly attributable to the acquisition of finished goods, materials and
services. Trade discounts, rebates and other similar items are deducted in
determining the costs of purchase.
An entity may purchase inventories on deferred settlement terms. In some
cases, the arrangement effectively contains an unstated financing element, for
example, a difference between the purchase price for normal credit terms and
the deferred settlement amount. In these cases, the difference is recognised as
interest expense over the period of the financing and is not added to the cost
of the inventories.
Costs of conversion
The costs of conversion of inventories include costs directly related to the
units of production, such as direct labour. They also include a systematic
allocation of fixed and variable production overheads that are incurred in
converting materials into finished goods. Fixed production overheads are
those indirect costs of production that remain relatively constant regardless of
the volume of production, such as depreciation and maintenance of factory
buildings and equipment, and the cost of factory management and
administration. Variable production overheads are those indirect costs of
production that vary directly, or nearly directly, with the volume of
production, such as indirect materials and indirect labour.
Allocation of production overheads
An entity shall allocate fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion
on the basis of the normal capacity of the production facilities. Normal
capacity is the production expected to be achieved on average over a number
of periods or seasons under normal circumstances, taking into account the
loss of capacity resulting from planned maintenance. The actual level of
production may be used if it approximates normal capacity. The amount of
fixed overhead allocated to each unit of production is not increased as a
consequence of low production or idle plant. Unallocated overheads are
recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred. In periods
of abnormally high production, the amount of fixed overhead allocated to
each unit of production is decreased so that inventories are not measured
above cost. Variable production overheads are allocated to each unit of
production on the basis of the actual use of the production facilities.

13.8
13.9
IFRS FOR SMES ACCOUNTING STANDARD

113
 Joint products and by-products
A production process may result in more than one product being produced
simultaneously. This is the case, for example, when joint products are
produced or when there is a main product and a by-product. When the costs
of raw materials or conversion of each product are not separately identifiable,
an entity shall allocate them between the products on a rational and
consistent basis. The allocation may be based, for example, on the relative
sales value of each product either at the stage in the production process when
the products become separately identifiable or at the completion of
production. Most by-products, by their nature, are immaterial. When this is
the case, the entity shall measure them at selling price less costs to complete
and sell and deduct this amount from the cost of the main product. As a
result, the carrying amount of the main product is not materially different
from its cost.
Other costs included in inventories
An entity shall include other costs in the cost of inventories only to the extent
that they are incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and
condition.
An entity applying paragraph 11.65(b) adjusts the carrying amount of a
commodity (hedged item) held for the change in the fair value of the hedged
item related to the hedged risk.
Costs excluded from inventories
Examples of costs excluded from the cost of inventories and recognised as
expenses in the period in which they are incurred are:
(a)
abnormal amounts of wasted materials, labour or other production
costs;
(b)
storage costs, unless those costs are necessary during the production
process before a further production stage;
(c)
administrative overheads that do not contribute to bringing
inventories to their present location and condition; and
(d)
selling costs.
[Deleted]
Cost of agricultural produce harvested from biological assets
Section 34 requires that inventories comprising agricultural produce that an
entity has harvested from its biological assets shall be measured on initial
recognition at their fair value less estimated costs to sell at the point of
harvest. This becomes the cost of the inventories at that date for application of
this section.

 Techniques for measuring cost, such as standard costing, retail
method and most recent purchase price
An entity may use techniques such as the standard cost method, the retail
method or most recent purchase price for measuring the cost of inventories if
the result approximates cost. Standard costs take into account normal levels
of materials and supplies, labour, efficiency and capacity utilisation. They are
regularly reviewed and, if necessary, revised in the light of current conditions.
The retail method measures cost by reducing the sales value of the inventory
by the appropriate percentage gross margin.
Cost formulas
An entity shall measure the cost of inventories of items that are not ordinarily
interchangeable and goods or services produced and segregated for specific
projects by using specific identification of their individual costs.
An entity shall measure the cost of inventories, other than those dealt with in
paragraph 13.17, by using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) or weighted average cost
formula. An entity shall use the same cost formula for all inventories having a
similar nature and use to the entity. For inventories with a different nature or
use, different cost formulas may be justified. The last-in, first-out method
(LIFO) is not permitted by this Standard.
Impairment of inventories
Paragraphs 27.2–27.4 require an entity to assess at the end of each reporting
period whether any inventories are impaired, ie the carrying amount is not
fully recoverable (for example, because of damage, obsolescence or declining
selling prices). If an item (or group of items) of inventory is impaired, those
paragraphs require the entity to measure the inventory at its selling price less
costs to complete and sell and to recognise an impairment loss. Those
paragraphs also require a reversal of a prior impairment in some
circumstances.
Recognition as an expense
When inventories are sold, the entity shall recognise the carrying amount of
those inventories as an expense in the period in which the related revenue is
recognised.
Some inventories may be allocated to other asset accounts, for example,
inventory used as a component of self-constructed property, plant or
equipment. Inventories allocated to another asset in this way are accounted
for subsequently in accordance with the section of this Standard relevant to
that type of asset.

 Section 14
Investments in Associates
Scope of this section
This section applies to accounting for associates in consolidated financial
statements and in the financial statements of an investor that is not a parent
but that has an investment in one or more associates. Paragraph 9.26
establishes the requirements for accounting for associates in separate
financial statements.
Associates defined
An associate is an entity over which the investor has significant influence.
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating
policy decisions of the associate but is not control or joint control over those
policies:
(a)
if an investor holds, directly or indirectly (for example, through
subsidiaries), 20 per cent or more of the voting power of the associate,
it is presumed that the investor has significant influence, unless it can
be clearly demonstrated that this is not the case;
(b)
conversely, if the investor holds, directly or indirectly (for example,
through subsidiaries), less than 20 per cent of the voting power of the
associate, it is presumed that the investor does not have significant
influence, unless such influence can be clearly demonstrated; and
(c)
a substantial or majority ownership by another investor does not
preclude an investor from having significant influence.
Measurement—accounting policy election
An investor shall account for all of its investments in associates using one of
the following:
(a)
the cost model in paragraph 14.5;
(b)
the equity method in paragraph 14.8; or
(c)
the fair value model in paragraph 14.9.
Cost model
An investor shall measure its investments in associates, other than those for
which there is a published price quotation (see paragraph 14.7) at cost less any
accumulated impairment losses recognised in accordance with Section 27
Impairment of Assets.
14.1
14.2
14.3
14.4
14.5
IFRS FOR SMES ACCOUNTING STANDARD
© IFRS Foundation
117
 The investor shall recognise dividends and other distributions received from
the investment as income without regard to whether the distributions are
from accumulated profits of the associate arising before or after the date of
acquisition.
An investor shall measure its investments in associates for which there is a
published price quotation using the fair value model (see paragraph 14.9).
Equity method
Under the equity method of accounting, an equity investment is initially
recognised at the transaction price (including transaction costs) and is
subsequently adjusted to reflect the investor’s share of the profit or loss and
other comprehensive income of the associate:
(a)
distributions and other adjustments to carrying amount. Distributions
received from the associate reduce the carrying amount of the
investment. Adjustments to the carrying amount may also be required
as a consequence of changes in the associate’s equity arising from
items of other comprehensive income.
(b)
potential voting rights. Although potential voting rights are considered in
deciding whether significant influence exists, an investor shall
measure its share of profit or loss and other comprehensive income of
the associate and its share of changes in the associate’s equity on the
basis of present ownership interests. Those measurements shall not
reflect the possible exercise or conversion of potential voting rights.
(c)
implicit goodwill and fair value adjustments. On acquisition of the
investment in an associate, an investor shall account for any difference
(whether positive or negative) between the cost of acquisition and the
investor’s share of the fair values of the net identifiable assets of the
associate in accordance with paragraphs 19.22–19.24 and 19.34. An
investor shall adjust its share of the associate’s profits or losses after
acquisition to account for additional depreciation or amortisation of
the associate’s depreciable or amortisable assets (including goodwill)
on the basis of the excess of their fair values over their carrying
amounts at the time the investment was acquired.
(d)
impairment. If there is an indication that an investment in an associate
may be impaired, an investor shall test the entire carrying amount of
the investment—including financial instruments that, in substance,
form part of the investor’s net investment in the associate—for
impairment in accordance with Section 27, as a single asset. A financial
instrument for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur
in the foreseeable future is, in substance, part of the investor’s net
investment (for example, this may include preference shares or
long-term receivables or loans). An investor shall apply Section 11 to
any such financial instrument before it applies this paragraph or
paragraph 14.8(h). Any goodwill included as part of the carrying
amount of the investment in the associate is not tested separately for
14.6
14.7
14.8
FEBRUARY 2025
118
© IFRS Foundation
 impairment but, instead, as part of the test for impairment of the
investment as a whole.
(e)
investor’s transactions with associates. The investor shall eliminate
unrealised profits and losses resulting from upstream (associate to
investor) and downstream (investor to associate) transactions to the
extent of the investor’s ownership interest in the associate. Unrealised
losses on such transactions may provide evidence of an impairment of
the asset transferred.
(f)
date of associate’s financial statements. In applying the equity method, the
investor shall use the financial statements of the associate as of the
same date as the financial statements of the investor unless it is
impracticable to do so. If it is impracticable, the investor shall use the
most recent available financial statements of the associate, with
adjustments made for the effects of any significant transactions or
events occurring between the accounting period ends.
(g)
associate’s accounting policies. If the associate uses accounting policies
that differ from those of the investor, the investor shall adjust the
associate’s financial statements to reflect the investor’s accounting
policies for the purpose of applying the equity method unless it is
impracticable to do so.
(h)
losses in excess of investment. If an investor’s share of losses of an associate
equals or exceeds the carrying amount of its investment in the
associate, the investor shall discontinue recognising its share of
further losses. The investment in an associate is the carrying amount
of the investment determined using the equity method together with
any financial instruments that in substance form part of the investor’s
net investment in the associate (see paragraph 14.8(d)). After the
investor’s interest is reduced to zero, the investor shall recognise
additional losses by a provision (see Section 21 Provisions and
Contingencies) only to the extent that the investor has incurred legal or
constructive obligations or has made payments on behalf of the
associate. If the associate subsequently reports profits, the investor
shall resume recognising its share of those profits only after its share
of the profits equals the share of losses not recognised.
(i)
discontinuing the equity method. An investor shall cease using the equity
method from the date that significant influence ceases:
(i)
if the associate becomes a subsidiary or a jointly controlled
entity, the investor shall remeasure its previously held equity
interest to fair value and recognise the resulting gain or loss, if
any, in profit or loss.
(ii)
if an investor loses significant influence over an associate as a
result of a full or partial disposal, it shall derecognise that
associate and recognise in profit or loss the difference between,
on the one hand, the sum of the proceeds received plus the fair
value of any retained interest and, on the other hand, the
IFRS FOR SMES ACCOUNTING STANDARD
© IFRS Foundation
119
 carrying amount of the investment in the associate including
goodwill at the date significant influence is lost. Thereafter, the
investor shall account for any retained interest using Section 11
Financial Instruments.
(iii)
if an investor loses significant influence for reasons other than
a partial disposal of its investment, the investor shall regard the
carrying amount of the investment at that date as a new cost
basis and shall account for the investment using Section 11.
Fair value model
When an investment in an associate is recognised initially, an investor shall
measure it at the transaction price. Transaction price excludes transaction
costs.
At each reporting date, an investor shall measure its investments in
associates at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss,
using the fair value measurement guidance in Section 12 Fair Value
Measurement. An investor using the fair value model shall use the cost model
for any investment in an associate for which fair value cannot be measured
reliably without undue cost or effort.
Financial statement presentation
An investor shall classify investments in associates as non-current assets.
Disclosures
An entity shall disclose the following:
(a)
its accounting policy for investments in associates;
(b)
the carrying amount of investments in associates (see paragraph 4.2(j));
and
(c)
the fair value of its investment in an associate if a market price for the
investment is quoted and the entity accounts for the associate using
the equity method.
For investments in associates accounted for using the cost model, an investor
shall disclose the amount of dividends and other distributions recognised as
income.
For investments in associates accounted for using the equity method, an
investor shall disclose separately its share of the profit or loss and its share of
any discontinued operations.
For investments in associates accounted for using the fair value model, an
investor shall make the disclosures required in Section 12. If an investor
applies the undue cost or effort exemption in paragraph 14.10 for any
associates it shall disclose that fact, the reasons why fair value measurement
would involve undue cost or effort and the carrying amount of investments in
associates accounted for under the cost model.

 Section 15
Joint Arrangements
Scope of this section
This section applies to accounting for joint arrangements in consolidated
financial statements and in the financial statements of an investor that is
not a parent but that has one or more joint arrangements. This section also
establishes requirements for a party that participates in but does not have
joint control in a joint arrangement. Paragraph 9.26 establishes the
requirements for accounting for a jointly controlled entity in separate
financial statements.
Joint arrangements defined
A joint arrangement is an arrangement of which two or more parties have
joint control. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an
arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities
require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
An entity that is a party to an arrangement shall assess whether the
contractual arrangement gives all the parties, or a group of the parties,
control of the arrangement collectively. All the parties, or a group of the
parties, control the arrangement collectively when they must act together to
direct the activities that significantly affect the returns of the arrangement
(that is, the relevant activities). Once it has been determined that all the
parties, or a group of the parties, control the arrangement collectively, joint
control exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the
unanimous consent of the parties that control the arrangement collectively.
Joint arrangements can take the form of jointly controlled operations, jointly
controlled assets or jointly controlled entities.
Jointly controlled operations
The operation of some joint arrangements involves the use of the assets and
other resources of the parties to the joint arrangement instead of the
establishment of a corporation, partnership or other entity, or a financial
structure that is separate from the parties themselves. Each party uses its own
property, plant and equipment and carries its own inventories. It also incurs
its own expenses and liabilities and raises its own finance, which represent its
own obligations. The joint arrangement activities may be carried out by the
party’s employees alongside the party’s similar activities. The joint
arrangement agreement usually provides a means by which the revenue from
the sale of the joint product and any expenses that are common to the parties
are to be shared among them.

 In respect of its interests in jointly controlled operations, a party shall
recognise in its financial statements:
(a)
the assets that it controls and the liabilities that it incurs; and
(b)
the expenses that it incurs and its share of the revenue that it earns
from the sale of goods or services by the joint arrangement.
Jointly controlled assets
Some joint arrangements involve the joint control, and often the joint
ownership, by the parties of one or more assets contributed to, or acquired for
the purpose of, the joint arrangement and dedicated to the purposes of the
joint arrangement.
In respect of its interest in a jointly controlled asset, a party shall recognise in
its financial statements:
(a)
its share of the jointly controlled assets, classified according to the
nature of the assets;
(b)
any liabilities that it has incurred;
(c)
its share of any liabilities incurred jointly with the other parties in
relation to the joint arrangement;
(d)
any revenue from the sale or use of its share of the output of the joint
arrangement, together with its share of any expenses incurred by the
joint arrangement; and
(e)
any expenses that it has incurred in respect of its interest in the joint
arrangement.
Jointly controlled entities
A jointly controlled entity is a joint arrangement that involves the
establishment of a corporation, partnership or other entity in which each
party has an interest. The entity operates in the same way as other entities,
except that an arrangement between the parties establishes joint control.
Measurement—accounting policy election
A party that has joint control shall account for all of its investments in jointly
controlled entities using one of the following:
(a)
the cost model in paragraph 15.10;
(b)
the equity method in paragraph 15.13; or
(c)
the fair value model in paragraph 15.14.

 Cost model
A party that has joint control shall measure its investments in jointly
controlled entities, other than those for which there is a published price
quotation (see paragraph 15.12) at cost less any accumulated impairment
losses recognised in accordance with Section 27 Impairment of Assets.
The party that has joint control shall recognise distributions received from the
investment as income without regard to whether the distributions are from
accumulated profits of the jointly controlled entity arising before or after the
date of acquisition.
Applying the cost model in paragraph 15.10, a party that has joint control
shall measure its investments in jointly controlled entities for which there is a
published price quotation using the fair value model (see paragraph 15.14).
Equity method
A party that has joint control shall measure its investments in jointly
controlled entities using the equity method following the procedures in
paragraph 14.8 (substituting ‘joint control’ where that paragraph refers to
‘significant influence’).
Fair value model
When an investment in a jointly controlled entity is recognised initially, a
party that has joint control shall measure it at transaction price. Transaction
price excludes transaction costs.
At each reporting date, a party that has joint control shall measure its
investments in jointly controlled entities at fair value, with changes in fair
value recognised in profit or loss, using the fair value measurement guidance
in Section 12 Fair Value Measurement. A party using the fair value model shall
use the cost model for any investment in a jointly controlled entity for which
fair value cannot be measured reliably without undue cost or effort.
Transactions between a party to the joint arrangement with joint
control and a joint arrangement
When a party to the joint arrangement that has joint control contributes or
sells assets to a joint arrangement, recognition of any portion of a gain or loss
from the transaction shall reflect the substance of the transaction. While the
assets are retained by the joint arrangement, and provided the party to the
joint arrangement has transferred the significant risks and rewards of
ownership, the party shall recognise only that portion of the gain or loss that
is attributable to the interests of the other parties. The party shall recognise
the full amount of any loss when the contribution or sale provides evidence of
an impairment loss.

 When a party to the joint arrangement that has joint control purchases assets
from a joint arrangement, that party shall not recognise its share of the
profits of the joint arrangement from the transaction until it resells the assets
to an independent party. A party to the joint arrangement shall recognise its
share of the losses resulting from these transactions in the same way as
profits except that losses shall be recognised immediately when they represent
an impairment loss.
If a party does not have joint control
A party that participates in, but does not have joint control of, a jointly
controlled entity shall account for its interest in the arrangement in
accordance with Section 11 Financial Instruments unless it has significant
influence over the jointly controlled entity, in which case it shall account for
the interest in the arrangement in accordance with Section 14 Investments in
Associates.
A party that participates in, but does not have joint control of, a jointly
controlled operation shall account for its interest in the arrangement in
accordance with paragraph 15.5.
A party that participates in, but does not have joint control of, jointly
controlled assets shall account for its interest in the arrangement in
accordance with paragraph 15.7.
Disclosures
An entity shall disclose the following:
(a)
the accounting policy it uses for recognising its investments in jointly
controlled entities;
(b)
the carrying amount of investments in jointly controlled entities (see
paragraph 4.2(k));
(c)
the fair value of its investment in a jointly controlled entity, if a
market price for the investment is quoted and the entity accounts for
the jointly controlled entity using the equity method; and
(d)
the aggregate amount of its commitments relating to jointly controlled
entities, including its share in the commitments that have been
incurred jointly with other parties.
For jointly controlled entities accounted for using the equity method, a party
that has joint control shall also make the disclosures required by
paragraph 14.14 for equity method investments.
For jointly controlled entities accounted for using the fair value model, a party
that has joint control shall make the disclosures required in Section 12. If a
party applies the undue cost or effort exemption in paragraph 15.15 for any
jointly controlled entity it shall disclose that fact, the reasons why fair value
measurement would involve undue cost or effort and the carrying amount of
investments in jointly controlled entities accounted for under the cost model.

 Section 16
Investment Property
Scope of this section
This section applies to accounting for investments in land or buildings that
meet the definition of investment property in paragraph 16.2 and some
property interests held by a lessee under an operating lease (see
paragraph 16.3) that are treated like investment property. Only investment
property whose fair value can be measured reliably without undue cost or
effort on an ongoing basis is accounted for in accordance with this section at
fair value through profit or loss. All other investment property is accounted
for using the cost model in Section 17 Property, Plant and Equipment and remains
within the scope of Section 17 unless a reliable measure of fair value becomes
available and it is expected that fair value will be reliably measurable on an
ongoing basis.
Definition and initial recognition of investment property
Investment property is property (land or a building, or part of a building, or
both) held by the owner or by the lessee under a finance lease to earn rentals
or for capital appreciation or both, instead of for:
(a)
use in the production or supply of goods or services or for
administrative purposes; or
(b)
sale in the ordinary course of business.
A property interest that is held by a lessee under an operating lease may be
classified and accounted for as investment property using this section if, and
only if, the property would otherwise meet the definition of an investment
property and the lessee can measure the fair value of the property interest
without undue cost or effort on an ongoing basis. This classification
alternative is available on a property-by-property basis.
An entity shall use its judgement to determine whether the acquisition of
investment property is the acquisition of an asset or a group of assets, or a
business combination within the scope of Section 19 Business Combinations and
Goodwill. Determining whether a specific transaction meets the definition of a
business combination as defined in Section 19 and includes an investment
property as defined in this section requires the separate application of both
sections.
Mixed use property shall be separated between investment property and
property, plant and equipment. However, if the fair value of the investment
property component cannot be measured reliably without undue cost or
effort, the entire property shall be accounted for as property, plant and
equipment in accordance with Section 17.

IFRS FOR SMES ACCOUNTING STANDARD

 Measurement at initial recognition
An entity shall measure investment property at its cost at initial recognition.
The cost of a purchased investment property comprises its purchase price and
any directly attributable expenditure such as legal and brokerage fees,
property transfer taxes and other transaction costs. If payment is deferred
beyond normal credit terms, the cost is the present value of all future
payments. An entity shall determine the cost of a self-constructed investment
property in accordance with paragraphs 17.10–17.14.
The initial cost of a property interest held under a lease and classified as an
investment property shall be as prescribed for a finance lease by
paragraph 20.9, even if the lease would otherwise be classified as an operating
lease if it was in the scope of Section 20 Leases. In other words, the asset is
recognised at the lower of the fair value of the property and the present value
of the minimum lease payments. An equivalent amount is recognised as a
liability in accordance with paragraph 20.9.
Measurement after recognition
Investment property whose fair value can be measured reliably without undue
cost or effort shall be measured at fair value at each reporting date with
changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss. If a property interest held
under a lease is classified as investment property, the item accounted for at
fair value is that interest and not the underlying property. Section 12 Fair
Value Measurement provides guidance on determining fair value. An entity shall
account for all other investment property using the cost model in Section 17.
Transfers
If a reliable measure of fair value is no longer available without undue cost or
effort for an item of investment property measured using the fair value
model, the entity shall thereafter account for that item in accordance with
Section 17 until a reliable measure of fair value becomes available. The
carrying amount of the investment property on that date becomes its cost
under Section 17. Paragraph 16.10(e)(iii) requires disclosure of this change. It
is a change of circumstances and not a change in accounting policy.
Other than as required by paragraph 16.8, an entity shall transfer a property
to, or from, investment property only when there is a change in use. A change
in use occurs when the property meets, or ceases to meet, the definition of
investment property and there is evidence of the change in use.
Disclosures
An entity shall disclose the following for all investment property accounted
for at fair value through profit or loss (paragraph 16.7):

 (b)
the extent to which the fair value of investment property (as measured
or disclosed in the financial statements) is based on a valuation by an
independent valuer who holds a recognised and relevant professional
qualification and has recent experience in the location and class of the
investment property being valued. If there has been no such valuation,
that fact shall be disclosed.
(c)
the existence and amounts of restrictions on the realisability of
investment property or the remittance of income and proceeds of
disposal.
(d)
contractual obligations to purchase, construct or develop investment
property or for repairs, maintenance or enhancements.
(e)
a reconciliation between the carrying amounts of investment property
at the beginning and end of the period, showing separately:
(i)
additions, disclosing separately those additions resulting from
acquisitions through business combinations;
(ii)
net gains or losses from fair value adjustments;
(iii)
transfers to and from investment property carried at cost less
accumulated 
depreciation 
and 
impairment 
(see
paragraph 16.8);
(iv)
transfers to and from inventories and owner-occupied
property; and
(v)
other changes.
This reconciliation need not be presented for prior periods.
In accordance with Section 20, the owner of an investment property provides
lessors’ disclosures about leases into which it has entered. An entity that holds
an investment property under a finance lease or operating lease provides
lessees’ disclosures for finance leases and lessors’ disclosures for any operating
leases into which it has entered.

 Section 17
Property, Plant and Equipment
Scope of this section
This section applies to accounting for property, plant and equipment and
accounting for investment property whose fair value cannot be measured
reliably without undue cost or effort on an ongoing basis. Section 16 Investment
Property applies to investment property whose fair value can be measured
reliably without undue cost or effort.
Property, plant and equipment are tangible assets that:
(a)
are held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, for
rental to others, or for administrative purposes; and
(b)
are expected to be used during more than one period.
Property, plant and equipment does not include:
(a)
biological assets related to agricultural activity (see Section 34
Specialised Activities). However, this section applies to bearer plants
that, at initial recognition, can be measured, both initially and on an
ongoing basis, separately from the produce on them without undue
cost or effort. This section applies to such bearer plants but not to the
produce on those bearer plants.
(b)
mineral rights and mineral reserves, such as oil, natural gas and
similar non-regenerative resources.
Recognition
An entity shall recognise the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment
as an asset if, and only if:
(a)
it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item
will flow to the entity; and
(b)
the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
Items such as spare parts, stand-by equipment and servicing equipment are
recognised in accordance with this section when they meet the definition of
property, plant and equipment. Otherwise, such items are classified as
inventory.
Parts of some items of property, plant and equipment may require
replacement at regular intervals (for example, the roof of a building). An
entity shall add to the carrying amount of an item of property, plant and
equipment the cost of replacing part of such an item when that cost is
incurred if the replacement part is expected to provide incremental future
benefits to the entity. The carrying amount of those parts that are replaced is
derecognised in accordance with paragraphs 17.27–17.30 regardless of
whether the replaced parts had been depreciated separately. If it is not
practicable for an entity to determine the carrying amount of the replaced
17.1
17.2
17.3
17.4
17.5
17.6

128
© IFRS Foundation
 part, the entity may use the cost of the replacement as an indication of what
the cost of the replaced part was at the time it was acquired or constructed.
Paragraph 17.16 provides that if the major components of an item of property,
plant and equipment have significantly different patterns of consumption of
economic benefits, an entity shall allocate the initial cost of the asset to its
major components and depreciate each such component separately over its
useful life.
A condition of continuing to operate an item of property, plant and
equipment (for example, a bus) may be performing regular major inspections
for faults regardless of whether parts of the item are replaced. When each
major inspection is performed, its cost is recognised in the carrying amount of
the item of property, plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition
criteria are satisfied. Any remaining carrying amount of the cost of the
previous major inspection (as distinct from physical parts) is derecognised.
This is done regardless of whether the cost of the previous major inspection
was identified in the transaction in which the item was acquired or
constructed. If necessary, the estimated cost of a future similar inspection
may be used as an indication of what the cost of the existing inspection
component was when the item was acquired or constructed.
Land and buildings are separable assets and an entity shall account for them
separately, even when they are acquired together.
Measurement at recognition
An entity shall measure an item of property, plant and equipment at initial
recognition at its cost.
Elements of cost
The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment comprises all of the
following:
(a)
its purchase price, including legal and brokerage fees, import duties
and non-refundable purchase taxes, after deducting trade discounts
and rebates.
(b)
any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and
condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner
intended by management. These can include the costs of site
preparation, initial delivery and handling, installation and assembly
and testing of functionality.
(c)
the initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item
and restoring the site on which it is located, the obligation for which
an entity incurs either when the item is acquired or as a consequence
of having used the item during a particular period for purposes other
than to produce inventories during that period.
17.7
17.8
17.9
17.10
IFRS FOR SMES ACCOUNTING STANDARD

129
 The following costs are not costs of an item of property, plant and equipment
and an entity shall recognise them as an expense when they are incurred:
(a)
costs of opening a new facility;
(b)
costs of introducing a new product or service (including costs of
advertising and promotional activities);
(c)
costs of conducting business in a new location or with a new class of
customer (including costs of staff training);
(d)
administration and other general overhead costs; and
(e)
borrowing costs (see Section 25 Borrowing Costs).
The income and related expenses of incidental operations during construction
or development of an item of property, plant and equipment are recognised in
profit or loss if those operations are not necessary to bring the item to its
intended location and operating condition.
Measurement of cost
The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment is the cash price
equivalent at the recognition date. If payment is deferred beyond normal
credit terms, the cost is the present value of all future payments.
Exchanges of assets
An item of property, plant or equipment may be acquired in exchange for a
non-monetary asset, or assets, or a combination of monetary and non-
monetary assets. An entity shall measure the cost of the acquired asset at fair
value unless (a) the exchange transaction lacks commercial substance or (b)
the fair value of neither the asset received nor the asset given up is reliably
measurable. In that case, the asset’s cost is measured at the carrying amount
of the asset given up.
Measurement after initial recognition
An entity shall choose either the cost model in paragraph 17.15A or the
revaluation model in paragraph 17.15B as its accounting policy and shall
apply that policy to an entire class of property, plant and equipment. An
entity shall apply the cost model to investment property whose fair value
cannot be measured reliably without undue cost or effort. An entity shall
recognise the costs of day-to-day servicing of an item of property, plant and
equipment in profit or loss in the period in which the costs are incurred.
Cost-model
An entity shall measure an item of property, plant and equipment after initial
recognition at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated
impairment losses.

 Revaluation model
An entity shall measure an item of property, plant and equipment whose fair
value can be measured reliably at a revalued amount, being its fair value at
the date of the revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and
subsequent accumulated impairment losses. Revaluations shall be made with
sufficient regularity to ensure that the carrying amount does not differ
materially from that which would be determined using fair value at the end
of the reporting period. Section 12 Fair Value Measurement provides guidance
on determining fair value. If an item of property, plant and equipment is
revalued, the entire class of property, plant and equipment to which that asset
belongs shall be revalued.
If an asset’s carrying amount is increased as a result of a revaluation, the
increase shall be recognised in other comprehensive income and
accumulated in equity under the heading of revaluation surplus. However,
the increase shall be recognised in profit or loss to the extent that it reverses a
revaluation decrease of the same asset previously recognised in profit or loss.
If an asset’s carrying amount is decreased as a result of a revaluation, the
decrease shall be recognised in profit or loss. However, the decrease shall be
recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent of any credit balance
existing in the revaluation surplus in respect of that asset. The decrease
recognised in other comprehensive income reduces the amount accumulated
in equity under the heading of revaluation surplus.
Depreciation
If the major components of an item of property, plant and equipment have
significantly different patterns of consumption of economic benefits, an entity
shall allocate the initial cost of the asset to its major components and
depreciate each such component separately over its useful life. Other assets
shall be depreciated over their useful lives as a single asset. With some
exceptions, such as quarries and sites used for landfill, land has an unlimited
useful life and therefore is not depreciated.
The depreciation charge for each period shall be recognised in profit or loss
unless another section of this Standard requires the cost to be recognised as
part of the cost of an asset. For example, the depreciation of manufacturing
property, plant and equipment is included in the costs of inventories (see
Section 13 Inventories).
Depreciable amount and depreciation period
An entity shall allocate the depreciable amount of an asset on a systematic
basis over its useful life.
Factors such as a change in how an asset is used, significant unexpected wear
and tear, technological advancement and changes in market prices may
indicate that the residual value or useful life of an asset has changed since the
most recent annual reporting date. If such indicators are present, an entity
shall review its previous estimates and, if current expectations differ, amend
17.15B

17.16
17.17

131
 the residual value, depreciation method or useful life. The entity shall account
for the change in residual value, depreciation method or useful life as a
change in an accounting estimate in accordance with Section 10 Accounting
Policies, Estimates and Errors.
Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use, ie when it is in the
location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the
manner intended by management. Depreciation of an asset ceases when the
asset is derecognised. Depreciation does not cease when the asset becomes idle
or is retired from active use unless the asset is fully depreciated. However,
under usage methods of depreciation the depreciation charge can be zero
while there is no production.
An entity shall consider all the following factors in determining the useful life
of an asset:
(a)
the expected usage of the asset. Usage is assessed by reference to the
asset’s expected capacity or physical output.
(b)
expected physical wear and tear, which depends on operational factors
such as the number of shifts for which the asset is to be used and the
repair and maintenance programme, and the care and maintenance of
the asset while idle.
(c)
technical or commercial obsolescence arising from changes or
improvements in production, or from a change in the market demand
for the product or service output of the asset. Expected future
reductions in the selling price of an item that was produced using an
asset could indicate the expectation of technical or commercial
obsolescence of the asset.
(d)
legal or similar limits on the use of the asset, such as the expiry dates
of related leases.
Depreciation method
An entity shall select a depreciation method that reflects the pattern in which
it expects to consume the asset’s future economic benefits. The possible
depreciation methods include the straight-line method, the diminishing
balance method and a method based on usage such as the units of production
method. A depreciation method that is based on revenue generated by an
activity that includes the use of an asset is not appropriate.
If there is an indication that there has been a significant change since the last
annual reporting date in the pattern by which an entity expects to consume
an asset’s future economic benefits, the entity shall review its present
depreciation method and, if current expectations differ, change the
depreciation method to reflect the new pattern. The entity shall account for
the change as a change in an accounting estimate in accordance with
Section 10.

 Impairment
Recognition and measurement of impairment
At each reporting date, an entity shall apply Section 27 Impairment of Assets to
determine whether an item or group of items of property, plant and
equipment is impaired and, if so, how to recognise and measure the
impairment loss. That section explains when and how an entity reviews the
carrying amount of its assets, how it determines the recoverable amount of
an asset, and when it recognises or reverses an impairment loss.
Compensation for impairment
An entity shall include in profit or loss compensation from third parties for
items of property, plant and equipment that were impaired, lost or given up
only when the compensation becomes receivable.
Property, plant and equipment held for sale
Paragraph 27.9(f) states that a plan to dispose of an asset before the previously
expected date is an indicator of impairment that triggers the calculation of
the asset’s recoverable amount for the purpose of determining whether the
asset is impaired.
Derecognition
An entity shall derecognise an item of property, plant and equipment:
(a)
on disposal; or
(b)
when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or
disposal.
An entity shall recognise the gain or loss on the derecognition of an item of
property, plant and equipment in profit or loss when the item is derecognised
(unless Section 20 Leases requires otherwise on a sale and leaseback). The
entity shall not classify such gains as revenue.
The date of disposal of an item is the date the recipient obtains control of that
item in accordance with the requirements in paragraphs 23.57–23.61 for
determining when a promise is fulfilled. Section 20 applies to disposal by a
sale and leaseback.
An entity shall determine the gain or loss arising from the derecognition of an
item of property, plant and equipment as the difference between the net
disposal proceeds, if any, and the carrying amount of the item.
Disclosures
An entity shall disclose the following for each class of property, plant and
equipment determined in accordance with paragraph 4.11(a) and separately

liabilities;
(b)
the amount of contractual commitments for the acquisition of
property, plant and equipment; and
(c)

 Section 18
Intangible Assets other than Goodwill
Scope of this section
This section applies to accounting for all intangible assets other than
goodwill (see Section 19 Business Combinations and Goodwill) and intangible
assets held by an entity for sale in the ordinary course of business (see
Section 13 Inventories and Section 23 Revenue from Contracts with Customers).
An intangible asset is an identifiable non-monetary asset without physical
substance. Such an asset is identifiable when:
(a)
it is separable, ie capable of being separated or divided from the entity
and 
sold, 
transferred, 
licensed, 
rented 
or 
exchanged, 
either
individually or together with a related contract, asset or liability; or
(b)
it arises from contractual or other legal rights, regardless of whether
those rights are transferable or separable from the entity or from other
rights and obligations.
This section does not apply to the following:
(a)
financial assets; or
(b)
mineral rights and mineral reserves, such as oil, natural gas and
similar non-regenerative resources.
Recognition
General principle for recognising intangible assets
An entity shall recognise an intangible asset as an asset if, and only if:
(a)
it is probable that the expected future economic benefits that are
attributable to the asset will flow to the entity;
(b)
the cost or value of the asset can be measured reliably; and
(c)
the asset does not result from expenditure incurred internally on an
intangible item.4
An entity shall assess the probability of expected future economic benefits
using reasonable and supportable assumptions that represent management’s
best estimate of the economic conditions that will exist over the useful life of
the asset.

This section uses the term ‘asset’ in a way that differs in some respects from the definition in
paragraph 2.44 and the Glossary. For the purpose of this section, an asset is a resource controlled
by the entity as a result of past events and from which future economic benefits are expected to
flow to the entity.
FEBRUARY 2025

© IFRS Foundation
 An entity uses judgement to assess the degree of certainty attached to the flow
of future economic benefits that are attributable to the use of the asset on the
basis of the evidence available at the time of initial recognition, giving greater
weight to external evidence.
The probability recognition criterion in paragraph 18.4(a) is always considered
satisfied for intangible assets that are separately acquired.
Acquisition as part of a business combination
An intangible asset acquired in a business combination shall be recognised
unless its fair value cannot be measured reliably without undue cost or effort
at the acquisition date.
Initial measurement
An entity shall measure an intangible asset initially at cost.
Separate acquisition
The cost of a separately acquired intangible asset comprises:
(a)
its purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable
purchase taxes, after deducting trade discounts and rebates; and
(b)
any directly attributable cost of preparing the asset for its intended
use.
Acquisition as part of a business combination
If an intangible asset is acquired in a business combination, the cost of that
intangible asset is its fair value at the acquisition date.
Acquisition by way of a government grant
If an intangible asset is acquired by way of a government grant, the cost of
that intangible asset is its fair value at the date the grant is received or
receivable in accordance with Section 24 Government Grants.
Exchanges of assets
An intangible asset may be acquired in exchange for a non-monetary asset or
assets, or a combination of monetary and non-monetary assets. An entity shall
measure the cost of such an intangible asset at fair value unless (a) the
exchange transaction lacks commercial substance or (b) the fair value of
neither the asset received nor the asset given up is reliably measurable. In that
case, the asset’s cost is measured at the carrying amount of the asset given
up.

 Internally generated intangible assets
An entity shall recognise expenditure incurred internally on an intangible
item, including all expenditure for both research and development activities,
as an expense when it is incurred unless it forms part of the cost of another
asset that meets the recognition criteria in this Standard.
As examples of applying the preceding paragraph, an entity shall recognise
expenditure on the following items as an expense and shall not recognise such
expenditure as intangible assets:
(a)
internally generated brands, logos, publishing titles, customer lists and
items similar in substance;
(b)
start-up activities (ie start-up costs), which include establishment costs
such as legal and secretarial costs incurred in establishing a legal
entity, expenditure to open a new facility or business (ie pre-opening
costs) and expenditure for starting new operations or launching new
products or processes (ie pre-operating costs);
(c)
training activities;
(d)
advertising and promotional activities;
(e)
relocating or reorganising part or all of an entity; and
(f)
internally generated goodwill.
Paragraph 18.15 does not preclude recognising a prepayment as an asset when
payment for goods or services has been made in advance of the delivery of the
goods or the rendering of the services.
Past expenses not to be recognised as an asset
Expenditure on an intangible item that was initially recognised as an expense
shall not be recognised at a later date as part of the cost of an asset.
Measurement after recognition
An entity shall measure intangible assets at cost less any accumulated
amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. The requirements for
amortisation are set out in this section. The requirements for recognition of
impairment are set out in Section 27 Impairment of Assets.
Useful life
For the purpose of this Standard, all intangible assets shall be considered to
have a finite useful life. The useful life of an intangible asset that arises from
contractual or other legal rights shall not exceed the period of the contractual
or other legal rights, but may be shorter depending on the period over which
the entity expects to use the asset. If the contractual or other legal rights are
conveyed for a limited term that can be renewed, the useful life of the
intangible asset shall include the renewal period(s) only if there is evidence to
support renewal by the entity without significant cost.

 If the useful life of an intangible asset cannot be established reliably, the life
shall be determined based on management’s best estimate but shall not
exceed ten years.
Amortisation period and amortisation method
An entity shall allocate the depreciable amount of an intangible asset on a
systematic basis over its useful life. The amortisation charge for each period
shall be recognised as an expense, unless another section of this Standard
requires the cost to be recognised as part of the cost of an asset such as
inventories or property, plant and equipment.
Amortisation begins when the intangible asset is available for use, ie when it
is in the location and condition necessary for it to be usable in the manner
intended by management. Amortisation ceases when the asset is derecognised.
The entity shall choose an amortisation method that reflects the pattern in
which it expects to consume the asset’s future economic benefits. If the entity
cannot determine that pattern reliably, it shall use the straight-line method.
There is a presumption that an amortisation method based on the revenue
generated by an activity that includes the use of an intangible asset is
inappropriate. However, an entity can rebut this presumption and use an
amortisation method based on revenue generated by an activity that includes
the use of an intangible asset only in the limited circumstances:
(a)
in which the intangible asset is expressed as a measure of revenue
(that is, when rights over the use of an intangible asset are specified as
a fixed total amount of revenue to be generated); or
(b)
when it can be demonstrated that revenue and the consumption of the
intangible asset’s future economic benefits are highly correlated.
Residual value
An entity shall assume that the residual value of an intangible asset is zero
unless:
(a)
there is a commitment by a third party to purchase the asset at the
end of its useful life; or
(b)
there is an active market for the asset and:
(i)
residual value can be determined by reference to that market;
and
(ii)
it is probable that such a market will exist at the end of the
asset’s useful life.
Review of amortisation period and amortisation method
Factors such as a change in how an intangible asset is used, technological
advancement and changes in market prices may indicate that the residual
value or useful life of an intangible asset has changed since the most recent
annual reporting date. If such indicators are present, an entity shall review

18.21

18.22A
18.23
18.24

 its previous estimates and, if current expectations differ, amend the residual
value, amortisation method or useful life. The entity shall account for the
change in residual value, amortisation method or useful life as a change in
accounting estimate in accordance with Section 10 Accounting Policies, Estimates
and Errors.
Recoverability of the carrying amount—impairment losses
To determine whether an intangible asset is impaired, an entity shall apply
Section 27. That section explains when and how an entity reviews the carrying
amount of its assets, how it determines the recoverable amount, of an asset
and when it recognises or reverses an impairment loss.
Retirements and disposals
An entity shall derecognise an intangible asset, and shall recognise a gain or
loss in profit or loss:
(a)
on disposal; or
(b)
when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or
disposal.
Disclosures
An entity shall disclose the following for each class of intangible assets:
(a)
the useful lives or the amortisation rates used;
(b)
the amortisation methods used;
(c)
the gross carrying amount and any accumulated amortisation
(aggregated with accumulated impairment losses) at the beginning and
end of the reporting period;
(d)
the line item(s) in the statement of comprehensive income (and in the
income statement, if presented) in which any amortisation of
intangible assets is included; and
(e)
a reconciliation of the carrying amount at the beginning and end of
the reporting period showing separately:
(i)
additions;
(ii)
disposals;
(iii)
acquisitions through business combinations;
(iv)
amortisation;
(v)
impairment losses recognised or reversed in profit or loss in
accordance with Section 27; and
(vi)
other changes.
This reconciliation need not be presented for prior periods.

of any individual intangible asset that is material to the entity’s
financial statements;
(b)
for intangible assets acquired by way of a government grant and
initially recognised at fair value (see paragraph 18.12):
(i)
the fair value initially recognised for these assets; and
(ii)
their carrying amounts.
(c)
the existence and carrying amounts of intangible assets to which the
entity has restricted title or that are pledged as security for liabilities;
and

been capitalised as part of the cost of another asset that meets the recognition
criteria in this Standard).

 Section 19
Business Combinations and Goodwill
Scope of this section
This section applies to a transaction or other event that meets the definition of
a business combination. It sets out requirements for how an acquirer
recognises and measures in its financial statements:
(a)
the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any
non-controlling interest in the acquiree; and
(b)
the goodwill acquired or a gain from a bargain purchase.
This section does not apply to:
(a)
combinations of entities or businesses under common control.
Common control means that all of the combining entities or
businesses are ultimately controlled by the same party or parties both
before and after the business combination, and that control is not
transitory.
(b)
formations of a joint arrangement in the financial statements of the
joint arrangement itself.
(c)
an acquisition of an asset or a group of assets that does not constitute a
business.
Identifying a business combination
An entity shall determine whether a transaction or other event meets the
definition of a business combination. A business combination is a transaction
or other event in which an entity (the acquirer) obtains control of one or more
businesses (the acquiree). Paragraphs 19A.1–19A.10 provide guidance on how
to determine whether the transaction or other event is a business
combination. If the assets acquired and liabilities assumed do not constitute a
business, the reporting entity shall account for the transaction or other event
as an asset acquisition.
An acquirer might obtain control of an acquiree in various ways—for
example, by:
(a)
transferring cash, cash equivalents or other assets (including net
assets that constitute a business);
(b)
incurring liabilities;
(c)
issuing equity instruments; or
(d)
providing more than one type of consideration.
A business combination might be structured in various ways for legal,
taxation or other reasons. Examples of these structures include transactions
or other events in which:
19.1
19.2
19.3
19.4
19.5
FEBRUARY 2025
142
© IFRS Foundation
 (a)
one or more businesses become subsidiaries of an acquirer, or the net
assets of one or more businesses are legally merged into the acquirer;
(b)
one combining entity transfers its net assets, or its owners transfer
their equity instruments, to another combining entity or its owners;
(c)
all of the combining entities transfer their net assets, or the owners of
those entities transfer their equity interests, to a newly formed entity;
or
(d)
a group of former owners of one of the combining entities obtains
control of the combined entity.
Accounting for business combinations and goodwill
An entity shall account for each business combination by applying the
acquisition method.
To apply the acquisition method, an entity shall:
(a)
identify the acquirer;
(b)
identify the acquisition date;
(c)
recognise and measure the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities
assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree; and
(d)
recognise and measure goodwill or a gain from a bargain purchase.
Identifying the acquirer
For each business combination, one of the combining entities shall be
identified as the acquirer.
Section 9 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements shall be used to identify
the acquirer—that is, to identify the entity that obtains control of another
entity (the acquiree).
If an entity applying Section 9 is not able to clearly identify which of the
combining entities is the acquirer, the entity shall consider the factors in
paragraphs 19A.11–19A.15 to make that determination.
Identifying the acquisition date
The acquirer shall identify the acquisition date—that is, the date on which the
acquirer obtains control of the acquiree.

 Recognising and measuring the identifiable assets
acquired, the liabilities assumed and any non-controlling
interest in the acquiree
Recognition principle
At the acquisition date, the acquirer shall recognise, separately from goodwill,
the 
identifiable 
assets 
acquired, 
the 
liabilities 
assumed 
and 
any
non-controlling interest in the acquiree—except as specified in paragraphs
19.16–19.21. An acquirer shall recognise the identifiable assets acquired and
liabilities assumed only if they:
(a)
meet the definitions of assets and liabilities in Section 2 Concepts and
Pervasive Principles at the acquisition date; and
(b)
are part of what the acquirer and the acquiree (or the acquiree’s
former owners) exchanged in the business combination transaction
rather than the result of separate transactions (see paragraph 19.32).
The acquirer and the acquiree might enter into separate transactions
before or during the negotiations for the business combination that
are not part of what is exchanged in the business combination. These
separate transactions shall be accounted for in accordance with the
applicable sections of this Standard.
Measurement principle
The acquirer shall measure the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities
assumed at their acquisition-date fair values—except as specified in
paragraphs 19.16–19.21.
For each business combination, the acquirer shall measure at the acquisition
date any non-controlling interests in the acquiree at the non-controlling
interest’s proportionate share of the recognised amounts of the acquiree’s
identifiable net assets.
Exceptions to the recognition and measurement principles
Paragraphs 19.16‒19.21 provide exceptions to the recognition and
measurement principles set out in paragraphs 19.12‒19.14 and specify both
the items for which exceptions are provided and the nature of those
exceptions.
An acquirer shall recognise an intangible asset acquired in a business
combination if the asset meets the recognition principles set out in Section 18
Intangible Assets other than Goodwill and the asset’s fair value can be measured
reliably without undue cost or effort at the acquisition date.
If an acquirer assumes a liability or contingent liability in a business
combination and that liability or contingent liability would have been within
the scope of Section 21 Provisions and Contingencies had the acquirer incurred it
separately, the acquirer shall apply paragraph 21.6 to determine whether a
present obligation exists at the acquisition date as a result of past events.

 If an acquirer determines, in accordance with paragraph 19.17, that a present
obligation exists, the acquirer shall recognise a contingent liability at the
acquisition date if:
(a)
the present obligation meets the definition of a contingent liability in
accordance with paragraph 21.12; and
(b)
the fair value of the contingent liability can be measured reliably.
Therefore, the acquirer recognises a contingent liability assumed in a business
combination at the acquisition date even if it is not probable that the acquirer
will be required to transfer economic benefits to settle the present obligation.
The 
acquirer 
does 
not 
apply 
the 
recognition 
requirements 
in
paragraphs 21.4(b) and 21.12 to a contingent liability assumed in a business
combination.
An acquirer shall recognise and measure in accordance with Section 29 Income
Tax a deferred tax asset or deferred tax liability arising from the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination.
An acquirer shall recognise and measure in accordance with Section 28
Employee Benefits a liability (or asset, if any) related to the acquiree’s employee
benefit arrangements.
Recognising and measuring goodwill or a gain from a
bargain purchase
The acquirer shall recognise goodwill as of the acquisition date measured as
the excess of (a) over (b):
(a)
the sum of:
(i)
the consideration transferred, measured in accordance with
paragraph 19.25;
(ii)
the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree,
measured in accordance with paragraph 19.14; and
(iii)
the acquisition-date fair value of the acquirer’s previously held
equity interest in the acquiree in the case of a business
combination achieved in stages (see paragraphs 19.29–19.30).
(b)
the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets
acquired and the liabilities assumed, measured in accordance with
paragraphs 19.13–19.21.
Bargain purchases
Occasionally, an acquirer will make a bargain purchase—a business
combination in which the amount in paragraph 19.22(b) exceeds the sum of
the amounts specified in paragraph 19.22(a). If an excess remains after an
acquirer applies paragraph 19.24, the acquirer shall recognise the resulting
gain in profit or loss on the acquisition date. The gain shall be attributed to
the acquirer.

IFRS FOR SMES ACCOUNTING STANDARD
© IFRS Foundation
145
 Before recognising a gain on a bargain purchase, the acquirer shall reassess
whether it has correctly identified all the assets acquired and all the liabilities
assumed and shall recognise any additional assets or liabilities identified in
that reassessment. The acquirer shall then review the procedures used to
measure the amounts required to be recognised at the acquisition date for:
(a)
the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed;
(b)
the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree, in the
case of a business combination achieved in stages; and
(c)
the consideration transferred.
Consideration transferred
An acquirer shall measure the consideration transferred in a business
combination at fair value. The acquirer shall calculate the consideration
transferred as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets
transferred by the acquirer, the liabilities incurred by the acquirer to the
former owners of the acquiree and the equity instruments issued by the
acquirer. Examples of consideration include cash, other assets, a business or a
subsidiary of the acquirer, contingent consideration, ordinary or preference
equity instruments, options and warrants.
Contingent consideration
The consideration an acquirer transfers in exchange for an acquiree includes
any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement
(see paragraph 19.25). The acquirer shall recognise the acquisition-date fair
value of contingent consideration as part of the consideration transferred in
exchange for the acquiree if the fair value of the contingent consideration can
be reliably measured without undue cost or effort.
If the acquirer cannot reliably measure the fair value of contingent
consideration at the acquisition date without undue cost or effort, it shall
measure the contingent consideration at the acquisition date using the most
likely amount of consideration. Subsequently, the acquirer shall not reassess
whether measuring the fair value of contingent consideration involves undue
cost or effort (see paragraph 19.37(b)).
The acquirer shall apply Section 22 Liabilities and Equity to classify an obligation
to pay contingent consideration that is a financial instrument as a financial
liability or as equity. An acquirer shall classify a right to the return of
previously transferred consideration as an asset. Paragraphs 19.36–19.37 set
out the requirements for accounting for contingent consideration.
A business combination achieved in stages
An acquirer sometimes obtains control of an acquiree in which it held an
equity interest immediately before the acquisition date. In such cases, the
acquirer shall remeasure its previously held equity interest in the acquiree at
its acquisition-date fair value and recognise the resulting gain or loss, if any,
in profit or loss.

© IFRS Foundation
 If a party to a joint arrangement obtains control of a business that is a jointly
controlled operation or a jointly controlled asset immediately before the
acquisition date, the transaction is a business combination achieved in stages
(a step acquisition). The acquirer shall apply the requirements for a business
combination achieved in stages in accordance with paragraph 19.29, including
remeasuring its entire previously held interest in the jointly controlled
operation or the jointly controlled asset.
Measurement period
If an acquirer’s initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by
the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the
acquirer shall recognise in its financial statements provisional amounts for
the items for which its accounting is incomplete. Within twelve months after
the acquisition date, the acquirer shall retrospectively adjust the provisional
amounts it recognised as assets and liabilities, and recognise any additional
assets and liabilities, to reflect new information it obtained about any relevant
facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date. Any adjustments
affect the goodwill acquired or any gain from a bargain purchase. After more
than twelve months have passed since the acquisition date, the acquirer shall
recognise adjustments to the initial accounting for a business combination
only if correcting an error in accordance with Section 10 Accounting Policies,
Estimates and Errors.
Acquisition-related costs
Acquisition-related costs are costs an acquirer incurs to effect a business
combination. The acquirer shall account for acquisition-related costs
separately from the business combination, as expenses in the periods in which
the costs are incurred and the services are received, with two exceptions: the
acquirer shall recognise the cost to issue debt in accordance with Section 11
Other Financial Instrument Issues and the cost to issue equity securities in
accordance with Section 22.
Subsequent measurement and accounting
After initial recognition, an acquirer shall apply the applicable sections of this
Standard to assets acquired, liabilities assumed or incurred, and equity
instruments issued in a business combination. After initial recognition,
paragraphs 19.34–19.37 apply to:
(a)
goodwill;
(b)
contingent liabilities recognised as of the acquisition date; and
(c)
contingent consideration.
Goodwill
After an acquirer initially recognises goodwill acquired in a business
combination, the acquirer shall measure it at cost less accumulated
amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. The acquirer shall apply:
19.30
19.31
19.32
19.33
19.34
IFRS FOR SMES ACCOUNTING STANDARD
© IFRS Foundation
147
 (a)
paragraphs 18.19–18.24 for amortisation of goodwill. If the acquirer
cannot reliably establish the useful life of goodwill, it shall use its best
estimate of the life, but that estimate shall not exceed ten years.
(b)
Section 27 Impairment of Assets to recognise and measure any
impairment of goodwill.
Contingent liabilities
After an acquirer initially recognises a contingent liability in a business
combination and until the liability is settled, cancelled or expires, it shall
measure the liability at the higher of:
(a)
the amount that the acquirer would have recognised in accordance
with Section 21; or
(b)
the amount the acquirer initially recognised minus, if appropriate, the
cumulative amount of income recognised in accordance with the
principles of Section 23 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
Contingent consideration
Changes resulting from events after the acquisition date (such as meeting an
earnings target, reaching a specified share price or reaching a milestone on a
research and development project) are not measurement-period adjustments
—except for the changes in the amount of contingent consideration that are
measurement-period adjustments in accordance with paragraph 19.31. An
acquirer shall account for changes in the amount of contingent consideration
that 
are 
not 
measurement-period 
adjustments 
in 
accordance 
with
paragraph 19.37.
If the contingent consideration is:
(a)
classified as equity the acquirer shall not remeasure that contingent
consideration and shall account for its subsequent settlement within
equity.
(b)
other contingent consideration:
(i)
whose fair value can be measured reliably without undue cost
or effort at the acquisition date—the acquirer shall measure
that contingent consideration at fair value at each reporting
date and shall recognise in profit or loss any changes in fair
value.
(ii)
whose fair value cannot be measured reliably without undue
cost or effort at the acquisition date (see paragraph 19.27)—the
acquirer shall review that contingent consideration at each
reporting date and adjust it to reflect the current estimate of
the most likely amount of the contingent consideration at that
reporting date. The acquirer shall recognise in profit or loss any
adjustments to the amounts it previously recognised.

 Appendix to Section 19
Application guidance
This appendix is an integral part of Section 19.
Definition of a business (application of paragraph 19.3)
A business is an integrated set of activities and assets that is capable of being
conducted and managed for the purpose of providing goods or services to
customers, generating investment income (such as dividends or interest) or
generating other income from ordinary activities. A business consists of
inputs and processes applied to those inputs that have the ability to contribute
to the creation of outputs. These are the three elements of a business and
their definitions:
(a)
an input is any economic resource that creates outputs or has the
ability to contribute to the creation of outputs when one or more
processes are applied to it. Examples of inputs include employees, non-
current assets, intellectual property and the ability to obtain access to
necessary materials or rights.
(b)
a process is any system, standard, protocol, convention or rule that,
when applied to an input or inputs, creates outputs or has the ability
to contribute to the creation of outputs. Examples of processes include
strategic management processes, operational processes and resource
management processes.
(c)
an output is the result of inputs and processes applied to those inputs
that provide goods or services to customers, generate investment
income or generate other income from ordinary activities.
Optional test to identify concentration of fair value
Paragraph 19A.3 sets out an optional concentration test for a simplified
assessment of whether an acquired set of activities and assets is a business. An
entity is permitted to choose whether to apply the test for each transaction or
other event. If the concentration test is:
(a)
met, the set of activities and assets is determined not to be a business
and no further assessment is necessary; or
(b)
not met (or if the entity chooses not to apply the test), the entity then
performs the assessment set out in paragraphs 19A.4–19A.10.
The concentration test is met, meaning an acquired set of activities and assets
is determined not to be a business, if substantially all of the fair value of the
gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of
similar identifiable assets. For the purposes of the concentration test:
(a)
gross assets acquired exclude cash and cash equivalents, deferred tax
assets and goodwill resulting from the effects of deferred tax liabilities;
19A.1
19A.2
19A.3
IFRS FOR SMES ACCOUNTING STANDARD
© IFRS Foundation
151
 (b)
the fair value of the gross assets acquired includes any consideration
transferred (plus the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share in
the recognised amounts of the acquiree’s net identifiable assets and
the fair value of any previously held interest) in excess of the fair value
of net identifiable assets acquired;
(c)
a single identifiable asset includes any asset or group of assets that
would be recognised and measured as a single identifiable asset in a
business combination;
(d)
if a tangible asset is attached to, and cannot be physically removed and
used separately from, another tangible asset without incurring
significant cost or significant diminution in utility or fair value to
either asset (for example, land and buildings), those assets shall be
considered a single identifiable asset; and
(e)
the nature of each single identifiable asset and the risk characteristics
(the risks associated with managing and creating outputs from the
assets) are considered to assess whether assets are similar.
Elements of a business
Although businesses usually have outputs, an integrated set of activities and
assets can have no outputs and still qualify as a business. If an integrated set
of activities and assets has two essential elements—inputs and processes
applied to those inputs—it can be conducted and managed for the purposes
identified in the definition of a business. A business need not include all of the
inputs or processes that the seller used in operating that business. However, to
be considered a business, an integrated set of activities and assets includes, at
a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly
contribute to the ability to create outputs. Paragraphs 19A.7–19A.10 specify
how to assess whether a process is substantive.
If an acquired set of activities and assets has outputs, a continuation of
revenue does not, on its own, show that the acquirer has acquired both an
input and a substantive process.
An acquirer determines whether a particular set of activities and assets is a
business based on whether the integrated set is capable of being conducted
and managed as a business by a market participant. It is not relevant whether
a seller operated the set as a business or whether an acquirer intends to
operate the set as a business.
Assessing whether an acquired process is substantive
Paragraphs 19A.8–19A.10 explain how to assess whether an acquired process
is substantive depending on whether the acquired set of activities and assets
has no outputs (paragraph 19A.9) or has outputs (paragraph 19A.10).
Figure 19.1 summarises how an entity assesses whether an acquired process is
substantive.

Paragraph 19A.9
Paragraph 19A.10
An example of an acquired set of activities and assets that does not have
outputs at the acquisition date is an early-stage entity that has not started
generating revenue. If an acquired set of activities and assets generates
revenue at the acquisition date, it is considered to have outputs at that date.
The acquired set has outputs even if it subsequently will no longer generate
revenue from external customers—for example, because it will be integrated
by an acquirer.
If a set of activities and assets does not have outputs at the acquisition date, an
acquired process (or group of processes) is considered substantive only if:
(a)
it is critical to the ability to develop or convert an acquired input or
inputs into outputs; and
(b)
the inputs acquired include both access to an organised workforce that
has the necessary skills, knowledge or experience to perform that
process (or group of processes) and other inputs that the organised
workforce could develop or convert into outputs. Those other inputs
could include:
(i)
intellectual property that could be used to develop a good or
service;
(ii)
other economic resources—for example, technology or real
estate—that could be developed to create outputs; or
19A.8
19A.9

153
 (iii)
rights to obtain access to necessary materials or rights that
enable the creation of future outputs.
If a set of activities and assets has outputs at the acquisition date, an acquired
process (or group of processes) is considered substantive if, when applied to an
acquired input or inputs, it:
(a)
is critical to the ability to continue producing outputs, and the inputs
acquired include access to an organised workforce with the necessary
skills, knowledge or experience to perform that process (or group of
processes); or
(b)
significantly contributes to the ability to continue producing outputs
and:
(i)
is considered unique or scarce; or
(ii)
cannot be replaced without significant cost, effort or delay in
the ability to continue producing outputs.
Identifying the acquirer (application of paragraphs 19.8–19.10)
In a business combination effected primarily by transferring cash or other
assets or by incurring liabilities, the acquirer is usually the entity that
transfers the cash or other assets or incurs the liabilities.
In a business combination effected primarily by exchanging equity
instruments, the acquirer is usually the entity that issues its equity
instruments. An entity considers other pertinent facts and circumstances to
identify the acquirer in a business combination effected by exchanging equity
instruments. For example, the acquirer is usually the combining entity:
(a)
whose owners, as a group, retain or receive after the business
combination the largest portion of the voting rights in the combined
entity;
(b)
whose single owner or organised group of owners holds the largest
minority voting interest in the combined entity, if no other owner or
organised group of owners has a significant voting interest;
(c)
whose owners have the ability to elect, appoint or remove a majority of
the members of the governing body of the combined entity;
(d)
whose (former) management dominates the senior management of the
combined entity; or
(e)
that pays a premium over the pre-combination fair value of the equity
instruments of the other combining entity or entities.
The acquirer is usually the combining entity whose size (measured in, for
example, assets, revenues or profit) is significantly greater than that of the
other combining entity or entities.

© IFRS Foundation
 In a business combination involving more than two entities, an entity
identifies the acquirer by considering, among other things, which of the
combining entities initiated the combination and the relative size of the
combining entities.
A new entity formed to effect a business combination is not necessarily the
acquirer. If a new entity is formed to issue equity instruments to effect a
business combination, one of the combining entities that existed before the
business combination is the acquirer, in accordance with paragraph 19.10 and
the guidance in paragraphs 19A.11–19A.14. In contrast, a new entity that
transfers cash or other assets or incurs liabilities as consideration might be
the acquirer.

 Section 20
Leases
Scope of this section
This section covers accounting for all leases other than:
(a)
leases to explore for or use minerals, oil, natural gas and similar
non-regenerative resources (see Section 34 Specialised Activities);
(b)
licensing agreements for such items as motion picture films, video
recordings, plays, manuscripts, patents and copyrights (see Section 18
Intangible Assets other than Goodwill);
(c)
measurement of property held by lessees that is accounted for as
investment property and measurement of investment property
provided by lessors under operating leases (see Section 16 Investment
Property);
(d)
measurement of biological assets held by lessees under finance leases
and biological assets provided by lessors under operating leases (see
Section 34);
(e)
leases that could lead to a loss to the lessor or the lessee as a result of
contractual terms that are unrelated to changes in the price of the
leased asset, changes in foreign exchange rates, changes in lease
payments based on variable market interest rates, or a default by one
of the counterparties (see paragraph 11.49(f)); and
(f)
operating leases that are onerous.
This section applies to agreements that transfer the right to use assets even
though substantial services by the lessor may be called for in connection with
the operation or maintenance of such assets. This section does not apply to
agreements that are contracts for services that do not transfer the right to use
assets from one contracting party to the other.
Some 
arrangements, 
such 
as 
some 
outsourcing 
arrangements,
telecommunication contracts that provide rights to capacity and take-or-pay
contracts, do not take the legal form of a lease but convey rights to use assets
in return for payments. Such arrangements are in substance leases of assets
and they shall be accounted for under this section.
Classification of leases
A lease is classified as a finance lease if it transfers substantially all the risks
and rewards incidental to ownership. A lease is classified as an operating lease
if it does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to
ownership.
20.1
20.2
20.3
20.4
FEBRUARY 2025

© IFRS Foundation
 Whether a lease is a finance lease or an operating lease depends on the
substance of the transaction instead of the form of the contract. Examples of
situations that individually or in combination would normally lead to a lease
being classified as a finance lease are:
(a)
the lease transfers ownership of the asset to the lessee by the end of
the lease term;
(b)
the lessee has the option to purchase the asset at a price that is
expected to be sufficiently lower than the fair value at the date the
option becomes exercisable for it to be reasonably certain, at the
inception of the lease, that the option will be exercised;
(c)
the lease term is for the major part of the economic life of the asset
even if title is not transferred;
(d)
at the inception of the lease the present value of the minimum lease
payments amounts to at least substantially all of the fair value of the
leased asset; and
(e)
the leased assets are of such a specialised nature that only the lessee
can use them without major modifications.
Indicators of situations that individually or in combination could also lead to a
lease being classified as a finance lease are:
(a)
if the lessee can cancel the lease, the lessor’s losses associated with the
cancellation are borne by the lessee;
(b)
gains or losses from the fluctuation in the residual value of the leased
asset accrue to the lessee (for example, in the form of a rent rebate
equalling most of the sales proceeds at the end of the lease); and
(c)
the lessee has the ability to continue the lease for a secondary period at
a rent that is substantially lower than market rent.
The examples and indicators in paragraphs 20.5 and 20.6 are not always
conclusive. If it is clear from other features that the lease does not transfer
substantially all risks and rewards incidental to ownership, the lease is
classified as an operating lease. For example, this may be the case if ownership
of the asset is transferred to the lessee at the end of the lease for a variable
payment equal to the asset’s then fair value, or if there are contingent rents,
as a result of which the lessee does not have substantially all risks and
rewards incidental to ownership.
Lease classification is made at the inception of the lease and is not changed
during the term of the lease unless the lessee and the lessor agree to change
the provisions of the lease (other than simply by renewing the lease), in which
case the lease classification shall be re-evaluated.

 Financial statements of lessees—finance leases
Initial recognition
At the commencement of the lease term, a lessee shall recognise its rights of
use and obligations under finance leases as assets and liabilities in its
statement of financial position at amounts equal to the fair value of the
leased property or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease
payments, determined at the inception of the lease. Any initial direct costs of
the lessee (incremental costs that are directly attributable to negotiating and
arranging a lease) are added to the amount recognised as an asset.
The present value of the minimum lease payments shall be calculated using
the interest rate implicit in the lease. If this cannot be determined, the
lessee’s incremental borrowing rate shall be used.
Subsequent measurement
A lessee shall apportion minimum lease payments between the finance charge
and the reduction of the outstanding liability using the effective interest
method (see paragraphs 11.15–11.20). The lessee shall allocate the finance
charge to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant
periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. A lessee
shall charge contingent rents as expenses in the periods in which they are
incurred.
A lessee shall depreciate an asset leased under a finance lease in accordance
with the relevant section of this Standard for that type of asset, for example,
Section 17 Property, Plant and Equipment or Section 18. If there is no reasonable
certainty that the lessee will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term,
the asset shall be fully depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and its
useful life. A lessee shall also assess at each reporting date whether an asset
leased under a finance lease is impaired (see Section 27 Impairment of Assets).
Disclosures
A lessee shall make the following disclosures for finance leases:
(a)
for each class of asset, the net carrying amount at the end of the
reporting period;
(b)
the total of future minimum lease payments at the end of the
reporting period, for each of the following periods:
(i)
not later than one year;
(ii)
later than one year and not later than five years; and
(iii)
later than five years.
(c)
a general description of the lessee’s significant leasing arrangements
including, for example, information about contingent rent, renewal or
purchase options and escalation clauses, subleases and restrictions
imposed by lease arrangements.

 In addition, the requirements for disclosure about assets in accordance with
Sections 17, 18, 27 and 34 apply to lessees for assets leased under finance
leases.
Financial statements of lessees—operating leases
Recognition and measurement
A lessee shall recognise lease payments under operating leases (excluding
costs for services such as insurance and maintenance) as an expense over the
lease term on a straight-line basis unless either:
(a)
another systematic basis is representative of the time pattern of the
user’s benefit, even if the payments are not on that basis; or
(b)
the payments to the lessor are structured to increase in line with
expected general inflation (based on published indexes or statistics) to
compensate for the lessor’s expected inflationary cost increases.
If payments to the lessor vary because of factors other than general inflation,
then the condition (b) is not met.
Example of applying paragraph 20.15(b):
X operates in a jurisdiction in which the consensus forecast by local banks is
that the general price level index, as published by the government, will
increase by an average of 10 per cent annually over the next five years.
X leases some office space from Y for five years under an operating lease.
The lease payments are structured to reflect the expected 10 per cent annual
general inflation over the five-year term of the lease as follows
Year 1
CU100,000
Year 2
CU110,000
Year 3
CU121,000
Year 4
CU133,000
Year 5
CU146,000
X recognises annual rent expense equal to the amounts owed to the lessor.
If the escalating payments are not clearly structured to compensate the
lessor for expected inflationary cost increases based on published indexes or
statistics, then X recognises annual rent expense on a straight-line basis:
CU122,000 each year (sum of the amounts payable under the lease divided
by five years).

 Disclosures
A lessee shall make the following disclosures for operating leases:
(a)
the total of future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable
operating leases for each of the following periods:
(i)
not later than one year;
(ii)
later than one year and not later than five years; and
(iii)
later than five years.
(b)
lease payments recognised as an expense; and
(c)
a general description of the lessee’s significant leasing arrangements
including, for example, information about contingent rent, renewal or
purchase options and escalation clauses, subleases, and restrictions
imposed by lease arrangements.
Financial statements of lessors—finance leases
Initial recognition and measurement
A lessor shall recognise assets held under a finance lease in its statement of
financial position and present them as a receivable at an amount equal to the
net investment in the lease. The net investment in a lease is the lessor’s gross
investment in the lease discounted at the interest rate implicit in the lease.
The gross investment in the lease is the aggregate of:
(a)
the minimum lease payments receivable by the lessor under a finance
lease; and
(b)
any unguaranteed residual value accruing to the lessor.
For finance leases other than those involving manufacturer or dealer lessors,
initial direct costs (costs that are incremental and directly attributable to
negotiating and arranging a lease) are included in the initial measurement of
the finance lease receivable and reduce the amount of income recognised over
the lease term.
Subsequent measurement
The recognition of finance income shall be based on a pattern reflecting a
constant periodic rate of return on the lessor’s net investment in the finance
lease. Lease payments relating to the period, excluding costs for services, are
applied against the gross investment in the lease to reduce both the principal
and the unearned finance income. If there is an indication that the estimated
unguaranteed residual value used in computing the lessor’s gross investment
in the lease has changed significantly, the income allocation over the lease
term is revised, and any reduction in respect of amounts accrued is recognised
immediately in profit or loss.

 Manufacturer or dealer lessors
Manufacturers or dealers often offer to customers the choice of either buying
or leasing an asset. A finance lease of an asset by a manufacturer or dealer
lessor gives rise to two types of income:
(a)
profit or loss equivalent to the profit or loss resulting from an outright
sale of the asset being leased, at normal selling prices, reflecting any
applicable volume or trade discounts; and
(b)
finance income over the lease term.
The sales revenue recognised at the commencement of the lease term by a
manufacturer or dealer lessor is the fair value of the asset or, if lower, the
present value of the minimum lease payments accruing to the lessor,
computed at a market rate of interest. The cost of sale recognised at the
commencement of the lease term is the cost, or carrying amount if different,
of the leased asset less the present value of the unguaranteed residual value.
The difference between the sales revenue and the cost of sale is the selling
profit, which is recognised in accordance with the entity’s policy for outright
sales.
If artificially low rates of interest are quoted, selling profit shall be restricted
to that which would apply if a market rate of interest were charged. Costs
incurred by manufacturer or dealer lessors in connection with negotiating and
arranging a lease shall be recognised as an expense when the selling profit is
recognised.
Disclosures
A lessor shall make the following disclosures for finance leases:
(a)
a reconciliation between the gross investment in the lease at the end of
the reporting period and the present value of minimum lease
payments receivable at the end of the reporting period. In addition, a
lessor shall disclose the gross investment in the lease and the present
value of minimum lease payments receivable at the end of the
reporting period, for each of the following periods:
(i)
not later than one year;
(ii)
later than one year and not later than five years; and
(iii)
later than five years.
(b)
unearned finance income.
(c)
the unguaranteed residual values accruing to the benefit of the lessor.
(d)
the accumulated allowance for uncollectable minimum lease payments
receivable.
(e)
contingent rents recognised as income in the period.

including, for example, information about contingent rent, renewal or
purchase options and escalation clauses, subleases, and restrictions
imposed by lease arrangements.
Financial statements of lessors—operating leases
Recognition and measurement
A lessor shall present assets subject to operating leases in its statement of
financial position according to the nature of the asset.
A lessor shall recognise lease income from operating leases (excluding
amounts for services such as insurance and maintenance) in profit or loss on a
straight-line basis over the lease term, unless either:
(a)
another systematic basis is representative of the time pattern of the
lessee’s benefit from the leased asset, even if the receipt of payments is
not on that basis; or
(b)
the payments to the lessor are structured to increase in line with
expected general inflation (based on published indexes or statistics) to
compensate for the lessor’s expected inflationary cost increases.
If payments to the lessor vary according to factors other than inflation, then
condition (b) is not met.
A lessor shall recognise as an expense costs, including depreciation, incurred
in earning the lease income. The depreciation policy for depreciable leased
assets shall be consistent with the lessor’s normal depreciation policy for
similar assets.
A lessor shall add to the carrying amount of the leased asset any initial direct
costs it incurs in negotiating and arranging an operating lease and shall
recognise such costs as an expense over the lease term on the same basis as
the lease income.
To determine whether a leased asset has become impaired, a lessor shall apply
Section 27.
A manufacturer or dealer lessor does not recognise any selling profit on
entering into an operating lease because it is not the equivalent of a sale.
Disclosures
A lessor shall disclose the following for operating leases:
(a)
the future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating
leases for each of the following periods:
(i)
not later than one year;
(ii)
later than one year and not later than five years; and
(iii)
later than five years.

In addition, the requirements for disclosure about assets in accordance with
Sections 17, 18, 27 and 34 apply to lessors for assets provided under operating
leases.
Sale and leaseback transactions
A sale and leaseback transaction involves the sale of an asset and the leasing
back of the same asset. The lease payment and the sale price are usually
interdependent because they are negotiated as a package. The accounting
treatment of a sale and leaseback transaction depends on the type of lease.
Sale and leaseback transaction results in a finance lease
If a sale and leaseback transaction results in a finance lease, the seller-lessee
shall not recognise immediately, as income, any excess of sales proceeds over
the carrying amount. Instead, the seller-lessee shall defer such excess and
amortise it over the lease term.
Sale and leaseback transaction results in an operating
lease
If a sale and leaseback transaction results in an operating lease, and it is clear
that the transaction is established at fair value, the seller-lessee shall recognise
any profit or loss immediately. If the sale price is below fair value, the
seller-lessee shall recognise any profit or loss immediately unless the loss is
compensated for by future lease payments at below market price. In that case
the seller-lessee shall defer and amortise such loss in proportion to the lease
payments over the period for which the asset is expected to be used. If the sale
price is above fair value, the seller-lessee shall defer the excess over fair value
and amortise it over the period for which the asset is expected to be used.
Disclosures
Disclosure requirements for lessees and lessors apply equally to sale and
leaseback transactions. The required description of significant leasing
arrangements includes description of unique or unusual provisions of the
agreement or terms of the sale and leaseback transactions.

 Section 21
Provisions and Contingencies
Scope of this section
This section applies to all provisions (liabilities of uncertain timing or
amount), contingent liabilities and contingent assets except those provisions
covered by other sections of this Standard, which include provisions relating
to:5
(a)
leases (Section 20 Leases). However, this section deals with operating
leases that have become onerous.
(b)
revenue from contracts with customers (Section 23 Revenue from
Contracts with Customers). However, this section deals with contracts
with customers that have become onerous.
(c)
employee benefit obligations (Section 28 Employee Benefits).
(d)
income tax (Section 29 Income Tax).
(e)
contingent consideration of an acquirer in a business combination
(Section 19 Business Combinations and Goodwill).
This section applies to financial guarantee contracts issued at nil
consideration when the specified debtor is another entity within the group.
Other issued financial guarantee contracts are in the scope of Part II of
Section 11 Financial Instruments.
The requirements in this section do not apply to executory contracts unless
they are onerous contracts. Executory contracts are contracts under which
neither party has fulfilled any of its obligations or both parties have partially
fulfilled their obligations to an equal extent.
The word ‘provision’ is sometimes used in the context of such items as
depreciation, impairment of assets and uncollectable receivables. Those are
adjustments of the carrying amounts of assets, instead of recognition of
liabilities, and therefore are not covered by this section.
Initial recognition
An entity shall recognise a provision only when:
(a)
the entity has an obligation at the reporting date as a result of a past
event;
(b)
it is probable (ie more likely than not) that the entity will be required
to transfer economic benefits in settlement; and
(c)
the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably.
21.1
21.1A
21.2
21.3
21.4
5
This section uses the term ‘liability’ in a way that differs in some respects from the definition in
paragraph 2.49 and the Glossary. For the purpose of this section, a liability is a present obligation
of the entity arising from past events, the settlement of which is expected to result in an outflow
from the entity of resources embodying economic benefits.
FEBRUARY 2025
164
© IFRS Foundation
 The entity shall recognise the provision as a liability in the statement of
financial position and shall recognise the amount of the provision as an
expense, unless another section of this Standard requires the cost to be
recognised as part of the cost of an asset such as inventories or property,
plant and equipment.
The condition in paragraph 21.4(a) (obligation at the reporting date as a result
of a past event) means that the entity has no realistic alternative to settling
the obligation. This can happen when the entity has a legal obligation that can
be enforced by law or when the entity has a constructive obligation because
the past event (which may be an action of the entity) has created valid
expectations in other parties that the entity will discharge the obligation.
Obligations that will arise from the entity’s future actions (ie the future
conduct of its business) do not satisfy the condition in paragraph 21.4(a), no
matter how likely they are to occur and even if they are contractual. To
illustrate, because of commercial pressures or legal requirements, an entity
may intend or need to carry out expenditure to operate in a particular way in
the future (for example, by fitting smoke filters in a particular type of factory).
Because the entity can avoid the future expenditure by its future actions, for
example by changing its method of operation or selling the factory, it has no
present obligation for that future expenditure and no provision is recognised.
A restructuring is a programme that is planned and controlled by
management and materially changes either the scope of a business
undertaken by an entity or the manner in which that business is conducted.
Examples of events that may fall under the definition of restructuring:
(a)
sale or termination of a line of business;
(b)
the closure of business locations in a country or region or the
relocation of business activities from one country or region to another;
(c)
changes in management structure—for example, eliminating a layer of
management; and
(d)
fundamental reorganisations that have a material effect on the nature
and focus of the entity’s operations.
A constructive obligation to restructure arises only when an entity:
(a)
has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring identifying at least:
(i)
the business or part of a business concerned;
(ii)
the principal locations affected;
(iii)
the location, function and approximate number of employees
who will be compensated for termination of their services;
(iv)
the expenditures that will be undertaken; and
(v)
when the plan will be implemented.
(b)
has raised a valid expectation in those affected that it will carry out the
restructuring by starting to implement that plan or announcing its
main features to those affected by it.

 Initial measurement
An entity shall measure a provision at the best estimate of the amount
required to settle the obligation at the reporting date. The best estimate is the
amount an entity would rationally pay to settle the obligation at the end of
the reporting period or to transfer it to a third party at that time:
(a)
when the provision involves a large population of items, the estimate
of the amount reflects the weighting of all possible outcomes by their
associated probabilities. Where there is a continuous range of possible
outcomes, and each point in that range is as likely as any other, the
mid-point of the range is used.
(b)
when the provision arises from a single obligation, the individual most
likely outcome may be the best estimate of the amount required to
settle the obligation. However, even in such a case, the entity considers
other possible outcomes. When other possible outcomes are either
mostly higher or mostly lower than the most likely outcome, the best
estimate will be a higher or lower amount than the most likely
outcome.
When the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of a
provision shall be the present value of the amount expected to be required to
settle the obligation. The discount rate (or rates) shall be a pre-tax rate (or
rates) that reflect(s) current market assessments of the time value of money.
The risks specific to the liability shall be reflected either in the discount rate
or in the estimation of the amounts required to settle the obligation, but not
both.
An entity shall exclude gains from the expected disposal of assets from the
measurement of a provision.
When some or all of the amount required to settle a provision may be
reimbursed by another party (for example, through an insurance claim), the
entity shall recognise the reimbursement as a separate asset only when it is
virtually certain that the entity will receive the reimbursement on settlement
of the obligation. The amount recognised for the reimbursement shall not
exceed the amount of the provision. The reimbursement receivable shall be
presented in the statement of financial position as an asset and shall not be
offset against the provision. In the statement of comprehensive income, the
entity may offset any reimbursement from another party against the expense
relating to the provision.
Subsequent measurement
An entity shall charge against a provision only those expenditures for which
the provision was originally recognised.
An entity shall review provisions at each reporting date and adjust them to
reflect the current best estimate of the amount that would be required to
settle the obligation at that reporting date. Any adjustments to the amounts
previously recognised shall be recognised in profit or loss unless the provision
21.7
21.8
21.9
21.10
21.11
FEBRUARY 2025

© IFRS Foundation
 was originally recognised as part of the cost of an asset (see paragraph 21.5).
When a provision is measured at the present value of the amount expected to
be required to settle the obligation, the unwinding of the discount shall be
recognised as a finance cost in profit or loss in the period it arises.
Contingent liabilities
A contingent liability is either a possible but uncertain obligation or a present
obligation that is not recognised because it fails to meet one or both of the
conditions (b) and (c) in paragraph 21.4. An entity shall not recognise a
contingent liability as a liability, except for contingent liabilities assumed in a
business combination applying paragraph 19.19. Disclosure of a contingent
liability is required by paragraph 21.15 unless the possibility of an outflow of
resources is remote. When an entity is jointly and severally liable for an
obligation, the part of the obligation that is expected to be met by other
parties is treated as a contingent liability.
Contingent assets
An entity shall not recognise a contingent asset as an asset. Disclosure of a
contingent asset is required by paragraph 21.16 when an inflow of economic
benefits is probable. However, when the flow of future economic benefits to
the entity is virtually certain, then the related asset is not a contingent asset,
and its recognition is appropriate.
Disclosures
Disclosures about provisions
For each class of provision, an entity shall disclose all of the following:
(a)
a reconciliation showing:
(i)
the carrying amount at the beginning and end of the period;
(ii)
additions during the period, including adjustments that result
from changes in measuring the discounted amount;
(iii)
amounts charged against the provision during the period; and
(iv)
unused amounts reversed during the period.
(b)
a brief description of the nature of the obligation and the expected
amount and timing of any resulting payments;
(c)
an indication of the uncertainties about the amount or timing of those
outflows; and
(d)
the amount of any expected reimbursement, stating the amount of any
asset that has been recognised for that expected reimbursement.
Comparative information for prior periods is not required.

 Disclosures about contingent liabilities
Unless the possibility of any outflow of resources in settlement is remote, an
entity shall disclose, for each class of contingent liability at the reporting date,
a brief description of the nature of the contingent liability and, when
practicable:
(a)
an estimate of its financial effect, measured in accordance with
paragraphs 21.7–21.11;
(b)
an indication of the uncertainties relating to the amount or timing of
any outflow; and
(c)
the possibility of any reimbursement.
If it is impracticable to make one or more of these disclosures, that fact shall
be stated.
Disclosures about contingent assets
If an inflow of economic benefits is probable (more likely than not) but not
virtually certain, an entity shall disclose a description of the nature of the
contingent assets at the end of the reporting period and, unless it would
involve undue cost or effort, an estimate of their financial effect, measured
using the principles set out in paragraphs 21.7–21.11. If such an estimate
would involve undue cost or effort, the entity shall disclose that fact and the
reasons why estimating the financial effect would involve undue cost or
effort.
Prejudicial disclosures
In extremely rare cases, disclosure of some or all of the information required
by paragraphs 21.14–21.16 can be expected to prejudice seriously the position
of the entity in a dispute with other parties on the subject matter of the
provision, contingent liability or contingent asset. In such cases, an entity
need not disclose the information, but shall disclose the general nature of the
dispute, together with the fact that, and reason why, the information has not
been disclosed.
Disclosures about financial guarantee contracts
An entity shall disclose for issued financial guarantee contracts in the scope of
this section (see paragraph 21.1A):
(a)
the nature and business purpose of these contracts;
(b)
an indication of the uncertainties relating to the amount or timing of
any outflow of resources; and
(c)
the maximum amount the entity could be required to pay if the
guarantees are called on.
An entity shall also make the disclosures required by Section 33 Related Party
Disclosures and, if applicable, the disclosures required by paragraphs 21.14 and
21.15.

 Appendix to Section 21
Illustrative examples
This appendix accompanies, but is not part of, Section 21. The examples illustrate how to apply the
requirements in Section 21 when recognising and measuring provisions.
All of the entities in the examples in this appendix have 31 December as their reporting
date. In all cases, it is assumed that a reliable estimate can be made of any outflows
expected. In some examples the circumstances described may have resulted in
impairment of the assets; this aspect is not dealt with in the examples. References to
‘best estimate’ are to the present value amount, when the effect of the time value of
money is material.
Example 1 Future operating losses
An entity determines that it is probable that a segment of its operations will
incur future operating losses for several years.
Present obligation as a result of a past obligating event—there is no past event
that obliges the entity to pay out resources.
Conclusion—the entity does not recognise a provision for future operating
losses. Expected future losses do not meet the definition of a liability. The
expectation of future operating losses may be an indicator that one or more
assets are impaired—see Section 27 Impairment of Assets.
Example 2 Onerous contracts
An onerous contract is one in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the
obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be
received under it. The unavoidable costs under a contract reflect the least net
cost of exiting from the contract, which is the lower of the cost of fulfilling it
and any compensation or penalties arising from failure to fulfil it. For
example, an entity may be contractually required under an operating lease to
make payments to lease an asset for which it no longer has any use.
Present obligation as a result of a past obligating event—the entity is
contractually required to pay out resources for which it will not receive
commensurate benefits.
Conclusion—if an entity has a contract that is onerous, the entity recognises
and measures the present obligation under the contract as a provision.
Example 3 Restructurings

Example 4 Warranties
A manufacturer gives warranties at the time of sale to purchasers of its
product. Under the terms of the contract for sale, the manufacturer
undertakes to make good, by repair or replacement, manufacturing defects
that become apparent within three years from the date of sale. On the basis of
21A.1
21A.2
21A.3
21A.4
IFRS FOR SMES ACCOUNTING STANDARD
© IFRS Foundation
169
 experience, it is probable (ie more likely than not) that there will be some
claims under the warranties.
Present obligation as a result of a past obligating event—the obligating event
is the sale of the product with a warranty, which gives rise to a legal
obligation.
An outflow of resources embodying economic benefits in settlement—
probable for the warranties as a whole.
Conclusion—the entity recognises a provision for the best estimate of the
costs of making good under the warranty products sold before the reporting
date.
Illustration of calculations:
In 20X0, goods are sold for CU1,000,000. Experience indicates that 90 per cent
of products sold require no warranty repairs; 6 per cent of products sold
require minor repairs costing 30 per cent of the sale price; and 4 per cent of
products sold require major repairs or replacement costing 70 per cent of sale
price. Consequently, estimated warranty costs are:
CU1,000,000 × 90% × 0
= CU0
CU1,000,000 × 6% × 30%
= CU18,000
CU1,000,000 × 4% × 70%
= CU28,000
Total
= CU46,000
The expenditures for warranty repairs and replacements for products sold in
20X0 are expected to be made 60 per cent in 20X1, 30 per cent in 20X2 and 10
per cent in 20X3, in each case at the end of the period. Because the estimated
cash flows already reflect the probabilities of the cash outflows, and assuming
there are no other risks or uncertainties that must be reflected, to determine
the present value of those cash flows the entity uses a ‘risk-free’ discount rate
based on government bonds with the same term as the expected cash outflows
(6 per cent for one-year bonds and 7 per cent for two-year and three-year
bonds). Calculation of the present value, at the end of 20X0, of the estimated
cash flows related to the warranties for products sold in 20X0 is as follows:
Year
Expected
cash
payments
(CU)
Discount
rate

The entity will recognise a warranty obligation of CU41,846 at the end of 20X0
for products sold in 20X0.

Example 6 Closure of a division―no implementation
before end of reporting period
On 12 December 20X0 the board of an entity decided to close down a division.
Before the end of the reporting period (31 December 20X0) the decision was
not communicated to any of those affected and no other steps were taken to
implement the decision.
Present obligation as a result of a past obligating event—there has been no
obligating event, and so there is no obligation.
Conclusion—the entity does not recognise a provision.
Example 7 Closure of a division―communication and
implementation before end of reporting period
On 12 December 20X0 the board of an entity decided to close a division
making a particular product. On 20 December 20X0 a detailed plan for closing
the division was agreed by the board, letters were sent to customers warning
them to seek an alternative source of supply and redundancy notices were
sent to the staff of the division.
Present obligation as a result of a past obligating event—the obligating event
is the communication of the decision to the customers and employees, which
gives rise to a constructive obligation from that date, because it creates a valid
expectation that the division will be closed.
An outflow of resources embodying economic benefits in settlement—
probable.
Conclusion—the entity recognises a provision at 31 December 20X0 for the
best estimate of the costs that would be incurred to close the division.
Example 8 Staff retraining as a result of changes in the
income tax system
The government introduces changes to the income tax system. As a result of
those changes, an entity in the financial services sector will need to retrain a
large proportion of its administrative and sales workforce in order to ensure
continued compliance with tax regulations. At the end of the reporting
period, no retraining of staff has taken place.
Present obligation as a result of a past obligating event—the tax law change
does not impose an obligation on an entity to do any retraining. An obligating
event for recognising a provision (the retraining itself) has not taken place.
Conclusion—the entity does not recognise a provision.

 Example 9 A court case
A customer has sued Entity X, seeking damages for injury the customer
allegedly sustained from using a product sold by Entity X. Entity X disputes
liability on grounds that the customer did not follow directions in using the
product. Up to the date the board authorised the financial statements for the
year to 31 December 20X1 for issue, the entity’s lawyers advise that it is
probable that the entity will not be found liable. However, when the entity
prepares the financial statements for the year to 31 December 20X2, its
lawyers advise that, owing to developments in the case, it is now probable that
the entity will be found liable:
(a)
at 31 December 20X1
Present obligation as a result of a past obligating event—on the basis of
the evidence available when the financial statements were approved,
there is no obligation as a result of past events.
Conclusion—no provision is recognised. The matter is disclosed as a
contingent liability unless the probability of any outflow is regarded as
remote.
(b)
at 31 December 20X2
Present obligation as a result of a past obligating event—on the basis of
the evidence available, there is a present obligation. The obligating
event is the sale of the product to the customer.
An outflow of resources embodying economic benefits in settlement—
probable.
Conclusion—a provision is recognised at the best estimate of the
amount to settle the obligation, and the expense is recognised in profit
or loss. It is not a correction of an error in 20X1 because, on the basis
of the evidence available when the 20X1 financial statements were
approved, a provision should not have been recognised at that time.

 Section 22
Liabilities and Equity
Scope of this section
This section establishes principles for classifying financial instruments as
either liabilities or equity and addresses accounting for equity instruments
issued to individuals or other parties acting in their capacity as investors in
equity instruments (ie in their capacity as owners). Section 26 Share-based
Payment addresses accounting for a transaction in which the entity receives
goods or services (including employee services) as consideration for its equity
instruments (including shares or share options) from employees and other
vendors acting in their capacity as vendors of goods and services.
This section shall be applied when classifying all types of financial
instruments except:
(a)
those interests in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements that
are accounted for in accordance with Section 9 Consolidated and Separate
Financial Statements, Section 14 Investments in Associates or Section 15 Joint
Arrangements.
(b)
employers’ rights and obligations under employee benefit plans, to
which Section 28 Employee Benefits applies.
(c)
[deleted]
(d)
financial instruments, contracts and obligations under share-based
payment transactions to which Section 26 applies, except that
paragraphs 22.3–22.6 shall be applied to treasury shares purchased,
sold, issued or cancelled in connection with employee share option
plans, employee share purchase plans and all other share-based
payment arrangements.
Classification of a financial instrument as liability or equity
Equity is the residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all its
liabilities. For the purpose of this section, a liability is a present obligation of
the entity arising from past events, the settlement of which is expected to
result in an outflow from the entity of resources embodying economic
benefits. Equity includes investments by the owners of the entity, plus
additions to those investments earned through profitable operations and
retained for use in the entity’s operations, minus reductions to owners’
investments as a result of unprofitable operations and distributions to owners.
An entity shall classify a financial instrument as a financial liability or as
equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement, not
merely its legal form, and in accordance with the definitions of a financial
liability and an equity instrument. Unless an entity has an unconditional right
to avoid delivering cash or another financial asset to settle a contractual
obligation, the obligation meets the definition of a financial liability, and is
22.1
22.2
22.3
22.3A
IFRS FOR SMES ACCOUNTING STANDARD
© IFRS Foundation
173
 classified as such, except for those instruments classified as equity
instruments in accordance with paragraph 22.4.
Some financial instruments that meet the definition of a liability are classified
as equity because they represent the residual interest in the net assets of the
entity:
(a)
a puttable instrument is a financial instrument that gives the holder
the right to sell that instrument back to the issuer for cash or another
financial asset or is automatically redeemed or repurchased by the
issuer on the occurrence of an uncertain future event or the death or
retirement of the instrument holder. A puttable instrument that has
all of the following features is classified as an equity instrument:
(i)
it entitles the holder to a pro rata share of the entity’s net
assets in the event of the entity’s liquidation. The entity’s net
assets are those assets that remain after deducting all other
claims on its assets.
(ii)
the instrument is in the class of instruments that is
subordinate to all other classes of instruments.
(iii)
all financial instruments in the class of instruments that is
subordinate to all other classes of instruments have identical
features.
(iv)
apart from the contractual obligation for the issuer to
repurchase or redeem the instrument for cash or another
financial asset, the instrument does not include any contractual
obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset to another
entity, or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities
with another entity under conditions that are potentially
unfavourable to the entity, and it is not a contract that will or
may be settled in the entity’s own equity instruments.
(v)
the total expected cash flows attributable to the instrument
over the life of the instrument are based substantially on the
profit or loss, the change in the recognised net assets or the
change in the fair value of the recognised and unrecognised net
assets of the entity over the life of the instrument (excluding
any effects of the instrument).
(b)
instruments, or components of instruments, that are subordinate to all
other classes of instruments are classified as equity if they impose on
the entity an obligation to deliver to another party a pro rata share of
the net assets of the entity only on liquidation.
The following are examples of instruments that are classified as liabilities
instead of equity:
(a)
an instrument is classified as a liability if the distribution of net assets
on liquidation is subject to a maximum amount (a ceiling). For
example, if on liquidation the holders of the instrument receive a pro
rata share of the net assets, but this amount is limited to a ceiling and
22.4
22.5
FEBRUARY 2025
174
© IFRS Foundation
 the excess net assets are distributed to a charity organisation or the
government, the instrument is not classified as equity.
(b)
a puttable instrument is classified as equity if, when the put option is
exercised, the holder receives a pro rata share of the net assets of the
entity measured in accordance with this Standard. However, if the
holder is entitled to an amount measured on some other basis (such as
local GAAP), the instrument is classified as a liability.
(c)
an instrument is classified as a liability if it obliges the entity to make
payments to the holder before liquidation, such as a mandatory
dividend.
(d)
a puttable instrument that is classified as equity in a subsidiary’s
financial statements is classified as a liability in its parent entity’s
consolidated financial statements.
(e)
a preference share that provides for mandatory redemption by the
issuer for a fixed or determinable amount at a fixed or determinable
future date, or gives the holder the right to require the issuer to
redeem the instrument at or after a particular date for a fixed or
determinable amount, is a financial liability.
Members’ shares in co-operative entities and similar instruments are equity if:
(a)
the entity has an unconditional right to refuse redemption of the
members’ shares; or
(b)
redemption is unconditionally prohibited by local law, regulation or
the entity’s governing charter.
Original issue of shares or other equity instruments
An entity shall recognise the issue of shares or other equity instruments as
equity when it issues those instruments and another party is obliged to
provide cash or other resources to the entity in exchange for the instruments:
(a)
if the equity instruments are issued before the entity receives the cash
or other resources, the entity shall present the amount receivable as an
offset to equity in its statement of financial position, unless local laws
or regulations prohibit such presentation (in which case the entity
shall comply with the presentation requirements in the local laws or
regulations);
(b)
if the entity receives the cash or other resources before the equity
instruments are issued, and the entity cannot be required to repay the
cash or other resources received, the entity shall recognise the
corresponding increase in equity to the extent of consideration
received; and
(c)
to the extent that the equity instruments have been subscribed for but
not issued, and the entity has not yet received the cash or other
resources, the entity shall not recognise an increase in equity.
22.6
22.7
IFRS FOR SMES ACCOUNTING STANDARD
© IFRS Foundation
175
 An entity shall measure equity instruments, other than those issued as part of
a business combination or those accounted for in accordance with
paragraphs 22.13–22.15B, at the fair value of the cash or other resources
received or receivable, net of transaction costs. If payment is deferred and the
time value of money is material, the initial measurement shall be on a
present value basis.
An entity shall account for the transaction costs of an equity transaction as a
deduction from equity. Income tax relating to the transaction costs shall be
accounted for in accordance with Section 29 Income Tax.
How the increase in equity arising on the issue of shares or other equity
instruments is presented in the statement of financial position is determined
by applicable laws. For example, the par value (or other nominal value) of
shares and the amount paid in excess of par value may be required to be
presented separately.
Sale of options, rights and warrants
An entity shall apply the principles in paragraphs 22.7–22.10 to equity issued
by means of sales of options, rights, warrants and similar equity instruments.
Capitalisation or bonus issues of shares and share splits
A capitalisation or bonus issue (sometimes referred to as a stock dividend) is
the issue of new shares to shareholders in proportion to their existing
holdings. For example, an entity may give its shareholders one dividend or
bonus share for every five shares held. A share split (sometimes referred to as
a stock split) is the dividing of an entity’s existing shares into multiple shares.
For example, in a share split, each shareholder may receive one additional
share for each share held. In some cases, the previously outstanding shares are
cancelled and replaced by new shares. Capitalisation and bonus issues and
share splits do not change total equity. An entity shall reclassify amounts
within equity as required by applicable laws.
Convertible debt or similar compound financial instruments
On issuing convertible debt or similar compound financial instruments that
contain both a liability and an equity component, an entity shall allocate the
proceeds between the liability component and the equity component. To make
the allocation, the entity shall first determine the amount of the liability
component as the fair value of a similar liability that does not have a
conversion feature or similar associated equity component. The entity shall
allocate the residual amount as the equity component. Transaction costs shall
be allocated between the debt component and the equity component on the
basis of their relative fair values.
The entity shall not revise the allocation in a subsequent period.
In periods after the instruments were issued, the entity shall account for the
liability component as follows:

© IFRS Foundation
 (a)
in accordance with Part I of Section 11 Financial Instruments if the
liability component meets the conditions in paragraph 11.9 or
paragraph 11.9ZA. In these cases, the entity shall systematically
recognise any difference between the liability component and the
principal amount payable at maturity as additional interest expense
using the effective interest method (see paragraphs 11.15–11.20).
(b)
in accordance with Part II of Section 11 if the liability component does
not meet the conditions in paragraph 11.9 or paragraph 11.9ZA.
Extinguishing financial liabilities with equity instruments
An entity may renegotiate the terms of a financial liability with a creditor of
the entity with the result that the entity extinguishes the liability fully or
partially by issuing equity instruments to the creditor. Issuing equity
instruments 
constitutes 
consideration 
paid 
in 
accordance 
with
paragraph 11.38. An entity shall measure the equity instruments issued at
their fair value. However, if the fair value of the equity instruments issued
cannot be measured reliably without undue cost or effort, the equity
instruments shall be measured at the fair value of the financial liability
extinguished. An entity shall derecognise the financial liability, or part of the
financial liability, in accordance with paragraphs 11.36–11.38.
If part of the consideration paid relates to a modification of the terms of the
remaining part of the liability, the entity shall allocate the consideration paid
between the part of the liability extinguished and the part that remains
outstanding. This allocation should be made on a reasonable basis. If the
remaining liability has been substantially modified, the entity shall account
for the modification as the extinguishment of the original liability and the
recognition of a new liability as required by paragraph 11.37.
An entity shall not apply paragraphs 22.15A–22.15B to transactions in
situations in which:
(a)
the creditor is also a direct or indirect shareholder and is acting in its
capacity as a direct or indirect existing shareholder;
(b)
the creditor and the entity are controlled by the same party or parties
before and after the transaction and the substance of the transaction
includes an equity distribution by, or contribution to, the entity; or
(c)
extinguishing the financial liability by issuing equity instruments is in
accordance with the original terms of the financial liability (see
paragraphs 22.13–22.15).
Treasury shares
Treasury shares are the equity instruments of an entity that have been issued
and subsequently reacquired by the entity. An entity shall deduct from equity
the fair value of the consideration given for the treasury shares. The entity
shall not recognise a gain or loss in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue
or cancellation of treasury shares.

 Distributions to owners
An entity shall reduce equity for the amount of distributions to its owners
(holders of its equity instruments). Income tax relating to distributions to
owners shall be accounted for in accordance with Section 29.
Sometimes an entity distributes assets other than cash to its owners (‘non-cash
distributions’). When an entity declares such a distribution and has an
obligation to distribute non-cash assets to its owners, it shall recognise a
liability. It shall measure the liability at the fair value of the assets to be
distributed unless it meets the conditions in paragraph 22.18A. At the end of
each reporting period and at the date of settlement, the entity shall review
and adjust the carrying amount of the dividend payable to reflect changes in
the fair value of the assets to be distributed, with any changes recognised in
equity as adjustments to the amount of the distribution. When an entity
settles the dividend payable, it shall recognise in profit or loss any difference
between the carrying amount of the assets distributed and the carrying
amount of the dividend payable.
If the fair value of the assets to be distributed cannot be measured reliably
without undue cost or effort, the liability shall be measured at the carrying
amount of the assets to be distributed. If prior to settlement the fair value of
the assets to be distributed can be measured reliably without undue cost or
effort, the liability is remeasured at fair value with a corresponding
adjustment made to the amount of the distribution and accounted for in
accordance with paragraph 22.18.
Paragraphs 22.18–22.18A do not apply to the distribution of a non-cash asset
that is ultimately controlled by the same party or parties before and after the
distribution. This exclusion applies to the separate, individual and
consolidated financial statements of an entity that makes the distribution.

If the fair value of the assets to be distributed as described in paragraphs
22.18–22.18A cannot be measured reliably without undue cost or effort, the
entity shall disclose that fact and the reasons why a reliable fair value
measurement would involve undue cost or effort.

 Appendix to Section 22
Illustrative example of the issuer’s accounting for convertible
debt
This appendix accompanies, but is not part of, Section 22. It provides guidance for applying the
requirements of paragraphs 22.13–22.15.
On 1 January 20X5 an entity issues 500 convertible bonds. The bonds are issued at par
with a face value of CU100 per bond and are for a five-year term, with no transaction
costs. The total proceeds from the issue are CU50,000. Interest is payable annually in
arrears at an annual interest rate of 4 per cent. Each bond is convertible, at the holder’s
discretion, into 25 ordinary shares at any time up to maturity. At the time the bonds are
issued, the market interest rate for similar debt that does not have the conversion option
is 6 per cent.
When the instrument is issued, the liability component must be valued first, and the
difference between the total proceeds on issue (which is the fair value of the instrument
in its entirety) and the fair value of the liability component is assigned to the equity
component. The fair value of the liability component is calculated by determining its
present value using the discount rate of 6 per cent. These calculations and journal entries
are illustrated:
CU
Proceeds from the bond issue (A)
50,000
Present value of principal at the end of five years (see calculations)
37,363
Present value of interest payable annually in arrears for five years
8,425
Present value of liability, which is the fair value of liability component (B)
45,788
Residual, which is the fair value of the equity component (A) – (B)
4,212
The issuer of the bonds makes the following journal entry at issue on 1 January 20X5:
Dr Cash
CU50,000
Cr Financial Liability – Convertible bond
CU45,788
Cr Equity
CU4,212
The CU4,212 represents a discount on issue of the bonds, so the entry could also be
shown ‘gross’:

Calculations
Present value of principal of CU50,000 at 6 per cent
CU50,000/(1.06)^5 = CU37,363
Present value of the interest annuity of CU2,000 (= CU50,000 × 4 per cent) payable at the end of each
of five years
The CU2,000 annual interest payments are an annuity—a cash flow stream with a limited
number (n) of periodic payments (C), receivable at dates 1 to n. To calculate the present
value of this annuity, future payments are discounted by the periodic rate of interest (i)
using the following formula:
^
Therefore, the present value of the CU2,000 interest payments is
(2,000/.06) × [1 – [(1/1.06)^5] = CU8,425

 This is equivalent to the sum of the present values of the five individual CU2,000
payments, as follows:
CU
Present value of interest payment at 31 December 20X5 = 2,000/1.06
1,887
Present value of interest payment at 31 December 20X6 = 2,000/1.06^2
1,780
Present value of interest payment at 31 December 20X7 = 2,000/1.06^3
1,679
Present value of interest payment at 31 December 20X8 = 2,000/1.06^4
1,584
Present value of interest payment at 31 December 20X9 = 2,000/1.06^5
1,495
Total
8,425
Yet another way to calculate this is to use a table of present value of an ordinary annuity
in arrears, five periods, interest rate of 6 per cent per period. (Such tables are easily found
on the Internet.) The present value factor is 4.2124. Multiplying this by the annuity
payment of CU2,000 determines the present value of CU8,425.

 Section 23
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
Scope of this section
This section applies to all contracts with customers, except:
(a)
lease contracts within the scope of Section 20 Leases;
(b)
insurance contracts;
(c)
financial instruments and other contractual rights or obligations
within the scope of Section 9 Consolidated and Separate Financial
Statements, Section 11 Financial Instruments, Section 14 Investments in
Associates or Section 15 Joint Arrangements; and
(d)
non-cash exchanges of products between entities in the same line of
business to help make sales to customers.
A contract with a customer might be partially within the scope of this section
and partially within the scope of other sections listed in paragraph 23.1. If one
of the other sections specifies how to initially measure any parts of the
contract, then an entity shall first apply the measurement requirements in
that section. Otherwise, the entity shall apply this section to initially measure
those parts of the contract.
Revenue recognition model
This section describes the revenue recognition model an entity shall apply to
account for revenue from contracts with customers. Applying the model
requires an entity to recognise an amount of revenue that depicts the goods or
services the entity has transferred to customers and that reflects the
consideration the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods
or services. An entity shall apply the model in five steps:
(a)
Step 1—Identify the contract(s) with a customer (see paragraphs
23.6–23.13);
(b)
Step 2—Identify the promises in the contract (see paragraphs
23.14–23.22);
(c)
Step 3—Determine the transaction price (see paragraphs 23.23–23.38);
(d)
Step 4—Allocate the transaction price to the promises in the contract
(see paragraphs 23.39–23.48); and
(e)
Step 5—Recognise revenue when (or as) the entity fulfils a promise (see
paragraphs 23.49–23.67).
An entity shall apply this section consistently to contracts with similar
characteristics and in similar circumstances.
23.1
23.2
23.3
23.4

 This section specifies how an entity accounts for an individual contract with a
customer. An entity is permitted to apply this section to a portfolio of similar
contracts (or promises) if the entity reasonably expects that the result of doing
so would not differ materially from the result of applying the section to each
individual contract (or promise).
Step 1—Identify the contract(s) with a customer
A contract is an agreement between two or more parties that creates
enforceable rights and obligations. Contracts can be written, oral or implied
by an entity’s usual business practices.
An entity shall apply the revenue recognition model to account for a contract
with a customer that is within the scope of this section only when all of the
following criteria are met:
(a)
the parties to the contract have approved the contract and are
committed to fulfilling their respective obligations;
(b)
the entity can identify each party’s rights in relation to the goods or
services to be transferred;
(c)
the entity can identify the payment terms for the goods or services to
be transferred;
(d)
the contract has commercial substance; and
(e)
it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration that it is
entitled to when the consideration is due.
If a contract with a customer meets the criteria in paragraph 23.7 at the start
of the contract, an entity shall reassess whether the contract meets the
criteria only if there is a significant change in relevant facts and
circumstances.
If a contract with a customer does not meet the criteria in paragraph 23.7, an
entity shall reassess the contract until the criteria are met.
When a contract with a customer does not meet the criteria in
paragraph 23.7, an entity shall recognise any consideration received from the
customer as a liability. If the consideration is non-refundable, the entity shall
derecognise the liability and recognise the consideration as revenue when
either:
(a)
the contract is complete and the entity has received all, or almost all,
of the consideration promised by the customer; or
(b)
the contract is cancelled.
Some contracts with customers might have no fixed duration or might
automatically renew periodically. An entity shall apply this section to the
duration of the contract in which the parties to the contract have present
enforceable rights and obligations.

IFRS FOR SMES ACCOUNTING STANDARD

 If a contract is modified, an entity shall account for the contract modification
by applying paragraphs 23A.2–23A.4.
Combination of contracts
An entity shall combine two or more contracts it has entered into at or near
the same time with the same customer (or related parties of the customer) and
account for the contracts as a single contract if one or more of the following
criteria are met:
(a)
the contracts are negotiated as a package with a single commercial
objective;
(b)
the amount of consideration the customer will pay in one of the
contracts depends on the price or performance of the other contract;
or
(c)
the goods or services promised in the contracts (or some goods or
services promised in each of the contracts) are a single promise in
accordance with Step 2.
Step 2—Identify the promises in the contract
A promise is an obligation to transfer a distinct good or service (or a distinct
bundle of goods or services). A contract with a customer might contain more
than one promise. At the start of a contract, an entity shall identify the goods
and services promised in the contract and determine which goods or services
are distinct.
An entity might transfer distinct goods or services to a customer that are
essentially the same, but at discrete instances over time (that is, transfer a
series of distinct goods or services). The entity shall account for those goods or
services as a single promise if:
(a)
each distinct good or service in the series would meet the criteria to be
a promise fulfilled over time (see paragraph 23.54); and
(b)
the entity would use the same method to measure its progress in
transferring control of each distinct good or service in the series to the
customer (see paragraphs 23.62–23.67).
A contract with a customer usually explicitly states the goods or services that
an entity promises to transfer. However, promises might be implied by an
entity’s usual business practices, published policies or specific statements, if
these create a valid expectation of the customer that the entity will transfer a
good or service to the customer.
A promise does not include activities that an entity must undertake to fulfil a
contract, such as set-up activities and administrative tasks, unless those
activities transfer a good or service to a customer. Non-refundable fees
charged to customers at or near the start of a contract often relate to activities
that do not transfer a good or service to the customer and, therefore, do not
give rise to a promise. In such cases, the non-refundable upfront fee is

23.16

 included in the transaction price and allocated to the promises in the contract
in accordance with Steps 3 and 4.
Distinct goods or services
A good or service is distinct if both of these criteria are met:
(a)
the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or
together with other resources readily available to the customer. A good
or service that an entity regularly sells separately is an example of a
good or service that meets this criterion.
(b)
the entity’s obligation to transfer the good or service is separate from
other obligations in the contract.
If a good or service promised to the customer is not distinct, an entity shall
combine that good or service with other goods or services in the contract until
it identifies a bundle of goods or services that is distinct. In some cases, the
entity will account for all the goods or services in a contract as a single
promise.
For the purpose of applying the criterion in paragraph 23.18(a), resources
readily available to the customer are:
(a)
goods or services sold separately, by the entity or another entity; or
(b)
goods or services the customer has already obtained from the entity,
including goods or services transferred to the customer under the
contract, or from other transactions or events.
For the purpose of applying the criterion in paragraph 23.18(b), factors that
suggest that the entity’s obligation to transfer a good or service is not separate
from other obligations in the contract include:
(a)
the entity integrating the goods or services in the contract in a way
that transforms them into a combined output (or outputs) for which
the goods or services are inputs. For example, a construction contract
in which an entity provides a contract management service that
integrates various goods or services in a way that transforms them into
the asset or assets to be constructed.
(b)
the good or service being modified or customised by another good or
service in the contract to the extent it is transformed. For example, a
contract in which an entity promises to provide existing software and
to customise that software, if the customisation service transforms the
software.
(c)
the good or service being highly dependent on, highly related to or
highly affected by another good or service in the contract. For
example, in some cases, two or more goods or services are highly
affected by each other because an entity would not be able to fulfil its
promise by transferring each of the goods or services separately.
23.18
23.19
23.20
23.21
IFRS FOR SMES ACCOUNTING STANDARD

185
 Distinct goods or services can include:
(a)
warranties (see paragraphs 23A.5–23A.7);
(b)
options to acquire additional goods or services (see paragraphs
23A.8–23A.13);
(c)
arranging for another party to transfer goods or services to the
customer if the entity is acting as an agent (see paragraphs
23A.14–23A.20); and
(d)
licences (see paragraphs 23A.28–23A.37).
Step 3—Determine the transaction price
The transaction price is the amount of consideration an entity expects to be
entitled to in exchange for transferring goods or services promised to a
customer, excluding amounts the entity collects on behalf of third parties (for
example, some sales taxes).
An entity shall determine the transaction price based on the terms of the
contract and its usual business practices. When determining the transaction
price, an entity shall assume the goods or services will be transferred to the
customer in accordance with the contract. The entity shall also assume the
contract will not be cancelled, renewed or modified.
If the consideration promised by the customer is in a form other than cash, an
entity shall measure the non-cash consideration by applying paragraphs
23A.21–23A.22.
Variable consideration
The consideration promised by a customer might vary because of factors such
as discounts, rebates, refunds, penalties or performance bonuses.
If the consideration includes a variable amount, an entity shall measure the
amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price by:
(a)
estimating the amount of variable consideration (see paragraphs
23.28–23.29); and
(b)
constraining that estimate (see paragraph 23.30).
An entity shall estimate an amount of variable consideration by using one of
two methods:
(a)
the expected value method—the sum of probability-weighted amounts
in a range of possible consideration amounts. This might be an
appropriate method if an entity has many contracts with similar
characteristics.

23.24
23.25
23.26
23.27
23.28
FEBRUARY 2025
186
© IFRS Foundation
 (b)
the most likely amount method—the most likely amount in a range of
possible consideration amounts (that is, the most likely outcome of the
contract). This might be an appropriate method if the contract has
only two possible outcomes (for example, an entity either achieves a
performance bonus or does not).
An entity shall apply one method to estimate the amount of variable
consideration consistently throughout the contract.
An entity shall include in the transaction price an amount of variable
consideration estimated in accordance with paragraph 23.28 only to the
extent that it is highly probable that an entity will become entitled to this
amount when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is
later resolved.
At the end of each reporting period, an entity shall update the amount of
variable consideration included in the transaction price to reflect any relevant
changes in circumstances. An entity shall allocate any subsequent changes in
the transaction price to the promises in the contract on the same basis it used
at the start of the contract. An entity shall recognise amounts allocated to a
fulfilled promise as revenue (or as a reduction of revenue) in the period in
which the estimate changes.
An entity shall apply paragraph 23A.37 to account for consideration in the
form of a royalty based on sales or use that is received in exchange for a
licence of intellectual property.
Refund liabilities
If an entity receives consideration from a customer and expects to refund
some or all of that consideration to the customer, the entity shall recognise a
refund liability.
The entity shall measure a refund liability by first applying paragraphs
23.27–23.30 to measure the amount of variable consideration to include in the
transaction price. The entity shall then recognise as a refund liability the
amount of consideration received (or receivable) for goods or services
transferred that is not included in the transaction price. At the end of each
reporting period, an entity shall update the estimate of the refund liability to
reflect consideration received (or receivable), goods or services transferred,
and changes in the transaction price in accordance with paragraph 23.31.
As an exception to paragraph 23.34, an entity shall apply paragraphs
23A.23–23A.27 to account for the variable consideration and refund liability
relating to a sale with a right of return.
Deferred payment
If payment is deferred and the arrangement constitutes a financing
transaction (see paragraph 11.13B), an entity shall discount the promised
amount of consideration at a market rate of interest for a similar debt
instrument as determined at the start of the contract. An entity shall
recognise the difference between the promised consideration and the
23.29
23.30
23.31
23.32
23.33
23.34
23.35
23.36

© IFRS Foundation
187
 discounted value of that amount as interest revenue in accordance with the
effective interest method (see paragraphs 11.15–11.20).
An entity shall present interest revenue separately from revenue from
contracts with customers.
An entity is permitted not to apply paragraphs 23.36–23.37 if, at the start of a
contract, it expects a customer to pay for goods or services within one year of
the entity transferring the goods or services.
Step 4—Allocate the transaction price to the promises in the
contract
An entity shall allocate the transaction price to each promise it has identified
in a contract in accordance with paragraphs 23.40–23.48.
Step 4 does not apply if an entity fulfils all promises in a contract:
(a)
in the same reporting period as the start of the contract; or
(b)
at the same point in time in accordance with paragraph 23.58.
Step 4 does not apply if a contract contains a single promise. However, an
entity shall apply paragraph 23.48 if the entity accounts for a series of distinct
goods or services as a single promise in accordance with paragraph 23.15 and
the transaction price includes an amount of variable consideration.
Allocation based on stand-alone selling prices
At the start of a contract, an entity shall determine the stand-alone selling
price of the distinct good or service (or distinct bundle of goods or services) in
each promise in the contract. The entity shall allocate the transaction price in
proportion to those stand-alone selling prices (that is, on a relative stand-alone
selling price basis). The entity shall not reallocate the transaction price to
reflect changes in the stand-alone selling prices after the start of the contract.
The ‘stand-alone selling price’ is the price at which an entity would separately
sell a good or service. The best evidence of a stand-alone selling price is the
observable price of a good or service when the entity sells that good or service
separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers.
If a stand-alone selling price is not directly observable, an entity shall estimate
that price. An entity shall take into account all information that is reasonably
available to it, including market conditions, entity-specific factors and
information about the customer or class of customer. An entity shall apply
estimation methods consistently in similar circumstances. Suitable estimation
methods might include using the entity’s competitor’s prices for similar goods
or services, or the expected costs of the good or service plus an appropriate
margin.
As an exception to paragraph 23.42, an entity might allocate a discount or
variable consideration using an alternative method (see paragraphs
23.46–23.48).

 Allocation of a discount and variable consideration
In a contract:
(a)
a customer receives a discount if the sum of the stand-alone selling
prices of the goods or services promised in the contract is greater than
the promised consideration; or
(b)
the transaction price might include an amount of variable
consideration (see paragraphs 23.26–23.32).
An entity shall allocate a discount or variable amount to each promise in the
contract on a relative stand-alone selling price basis. However, if allocating the
discount or variable amount on this basis does not represent the amount of
consideration the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for fulfilling
each promise in the contract, the entity shall use another method to allocate
the discount or variable amount. For example, the entity might allocate the
discount or variable amount to one, or some, of the promises in the contract.
If an entity accounts for a series of distinct goods or services as a single
promise in accordance with paragraph 23.15, it shall allocate a variable
amount to each distinct good or service on a relative stand-alone selling price
basis. However, if allocating the variable amount on this basis does not
represent the amount of consideration the entity expects to be entitled to in
exchange for transferring each distinct good or service in the promise, the
entity shall use another method to allocate the variable amount. For example,
the entity might allocate the variable amount to one, or some, of the distinct
goods or services in the promise.
Step 5—Recognise revenue when (or as) the entity fulfils a
promise
An entity shall recognise revenue when (or as) it fulfils a promise. An entity
fulfils a promise by transferring control of the distinct good or service in the
promise to the customer.
Goods and services are assets, even if only momentarily, when they are
received and used. An entity transfers control of an asset when the customer
has the present ability to direct the use of the asset and obtain the economic
benefits that might flow from it.
When evaluating whether a customer obtains control of an asset, an entity
shall consider any agreements to repurchase the asset. The customer does not
obtain control of the asset if the entity has a right and obligation to
repurchase the asset (a forward) or a right to repurchase the asset (a call
option).
At the start of a contract, an entity shall determine whether it transfers
control of the distinct good or service in a promise to a customer either:
(a)
over time, in which case the entity fulfils the promise (and recognises
revenue) over time in accordance with paragraphs 23.54–23.56; or

23.48
23.49
23.50

189
 (b)
at a point in time, in which case the entity fulfils the promise (and
recognises revenue) at a point in time in accordance with paragraphs
23.57–23.61.
If a contract with a customer includes a licence that is distinct from the other
goods or services in the contract, an entity shall apply paragraphs
23A.28–23A.36 to determine whether the promise to grant the licence is
fulfilled over time or at a point in time.
Promises fulfilled over time
An entity transfers control of a distinct good or service over time, and
therefore fulfils a promise over time, if any of these criteria is met:
(a)
a customer receives and immediately uses the benefits from the
entity’s performance as the entity performs (for example, a routine or
recurring cleaning service);
(b)
a customer controls the asset as the entity makes or improves the asset
(for example, a construction contract in which the customer controls
the work in progress); or
(c)
the asset created by the entity’s performance cannot be easily
redirected to another customer (see paragraph 23.55) and the original
customer is obliged to pay the entity for work done to date (see
paragraph 23.56) (for example, a service contract in which an entity
provides a professional opinion to a customer that is based on facts and
circumstances specific to the customer, and it is obliged to pay the
entity for work done to date).
An asset cannot be easily redirected to another customer if:
(a)
the entity would either sell the finished asset to another customer at a
significantly lower price than that paid by the original customer, or
incur significant costs, compared with the cost of the asset, to rework
the finished asset for sale (for example, if an asset was highly
customised for a particular customer); or
(b)
substantive contractual restrictions prohibit the entity from selling the
asset to another customer as that asset is made or improved (for
example, if the entity is legally obliged to sell work in progress to the
customer).
A customer might be obliged to pay an entity for work done to date because of
specific terms in the contract or laws that apply to that contract. The
customer is obliged to pay the entity for work done to date if the entity has
either:
(a)
a present unconditional right to payment for work done to date; or
(b)
an enforceable right to demand or keep payment for work done to date
if the contract is cancelled before it is complete for any reason other
than the entity’s failure to perform as agreed.

 Promises fulfilled at a point in time
If an entity does not transfer control of a distinct good or service over time,
the entity transfers control of the good or service at a point in time, and
therefore fulfils a promise at a point in time.
For each promise an entity fulfils at a point in time, the entity shall recognise
revenue at the specific point in time a customer obtains control of the distinct
good or service. To identify this point in time, an entity shall consider
indicators of the transfer of control, which include:
(a)
the entity having a present right to payment for the asset;
(b)
the customer having legal title to the asset;
(c)
the customer having physical possession of the asset;
(d)
the customer having the significant risks and rewards of ownership of
the asset; and
(e)
the customer having accepted the asset (see paragraphs 23.60–23.61).
The indicators in paragraph 23.58 are not always conclusive. Consequently,
the absence of an indicator would not preclude the customer from obtaining
control of an asset. If it is clear from other features of the transaction that the
customer has the present ability to direct the use of the asset and obtain the
economic benefits that might flow from it, the customer has obtained control
of the asset.
Customer acceptance
Customer acceptance clauses allow a customer to cancel a contract or require
an entity to take remedial action if a good or service does not meet agreed-
upon specifications.
If a contract includes a customer acceptance clause and the entity cannot
identify whether a good or service meets the agreed-upon specifications based
on the information available to the entity, it shall wait until it receives the
customer’s acceptance before it concludes that the customer has obtained
control of the good or service.
Measuring progress towards fulfilment of a promise
For each promise fulfilled over time in accordance with paragraphs
23.54–23.56, an entity shall calculate how much revenue to recognise in each
reporting period by measuring its progress towards fulfilment of that promise
at the end of the period.
An entity shall choose a method of measuring progress that depicts the
entity’s performance in transferring control of goods or services promised to
the customer. An entity shall apply one method of measuring progress for
each promise fulfilled over time and shall apply that method consistently to
similar promises and in similar circumstances.

 At the end of each reporting period, an entity shall remeasure its progress
towards fulfilment of a promise to reflect any changes in circumstances. The
entity shall account for changes to the measure of progress as a change in
accounting estimate in accordance with Section 10 Accounting Policies, Estimates
and Errors.
When choosing which method to use to measure its progress, an entity shall
consider the nature of the good or service it will transfer to a customer.
Appropriate methods of measuring progress include methods that recognise
revenue based on:
(a)
the value to the customer of the goods or services transferred to date
relative to the remaining goods or services to be transferred under the
contract (‘output methods’); and
(b)
the entity’s efforts or inputs to fulfil a promise relative to the total
expected inputs to fulfil the promise (‘input methods’).
Common methods, and circumstances in which they might be appropriate,
include:
(a)
an output method based on surveys of completed work, if the surveys
give an objective measure of an entity’s performance to date;
(b)
an output method based on units delivered, if each item transfers an
equal amount of value to the customer on delivery;
(c)
an output method based on time elapsed, if control of the goods or
services is transferred evenly over time;
(d)
an input method based on time elapsed, if an entity’s efforts or inputs
are spent evenly throughout the performance period;
(e)
an input method based on labour hours spent, if the labour hours
spent and the transfer of control of goods or services to the customer
are related; and
(f)
an input method based on costs incurred, excluding costs that do not
contribute, or are not proportionate, to the entity’s progress towards
fulfilment of the promise (for example, inefficiencies and wasted or
uninstalled materials).
If an entity has a right to consideration from the customer in an amount that
relates directly to the value to the customer of the entity’s work to date (for
example, a service contract in which an entity bills a fixed amount for each
hour of service provided), the entity is permitted to recognise revenue in the
amount it has a right to invoice.

 Contract costs
Costs to obtain a contract
An entity shall recognise the costs of obtaining a contract with a customer as
an expense when incurred, unless another section of this Standard requires
the costs to be recognised as part of the cost of an asset.
Costs to fulfil a contract
An entity shall account for the costs incurred to fulfil a contract with a
customer in accordance with the relevant section of this Standard for those
costs (for example, Section 13 Inventories, Section 17 Property, Plant and
Equipment or Section 18 Intangible Assets other than Goodwill).
If the costs incurred to fulfil a contract are not within the scope of another
section of this Standard, an entity shall recognise those costs as an asset if:
(a)
the costs relate directly to a contract (including future contracts) that
the entity can specifically identify (for example, costs relating to a
specific contract that has not yet been approved) (see paragraph 23.71);
(b)
the costs create or improve the entity’s resources that it will use to
fulfil (or continue to fulfil) promises in the future; and
(c)
the entity expects to recover the costs.
Costs that relate directly to a contract include direct labour, direct materials
and allocations of costs that relate directly to the contract or contract
activities.
General and administrative costs do not normally satisfy the criteria in
paragraph 23.70 and are therefore recognised as expenses when incurred.
An entity shall recognise costs that relate to promises that are fulfilled (or
partially fulfilled) as expenses when incurred, because those costs relate to
past performance.
Measurement after recognition
After initial recognition, an entity shall measure assets arising from the costs
to fulfil a contract in accordance with paragraph 23.70 at cost less
accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses:
(a)
an entity shall amortise the asset based on the pattern of transfer of
the goods or services to which the asset relates.
(b)
an entity shall follow Section 27 Impairment of Assets to recognise and
measure the impairment of the asset. However, the entity shall apply
paragraphs 23.75–23.76 instead of paragraphs 27.11–27.20 to estimate
the recoverable amount of the asset.

23.70
23.71
23.72
23.73
23.74
IFRS FOR SMES ACCOUNTING STANDARD
© IFRS Foundation
193
 For the purpose of measuring impairment losses, the recoverable amount of
an asset arising from the costs to fulfil a contract is:
(a)
the remaining amount of consideration that the entity expects to
receive in exchange for the goods or services to which the asset relates
(see paragraph 23.76); minus
(b)
the remaining costs of providing those goods or services not yet
incurred.
In measuring the remaining amount of consideration, the amount shall only
include consideration for which collection is probable.
Contract balances
When either party to a contract has performed, an entity shall present the
contract in the statement of financial position as either a contract asset or a
contract liability based on the contract as a whole. The presentation of the
contract balance depends on the relationship between:
(a)
the entity’s performance in transferring the goods or services promised
in the contract to the customer; and
(b)
the customer’s payment.
If an entity has received consideration (or has a trade receivable) before it
transfers goods or services to the customer, the entity shall recognise a
contract liability when the payment is made or due, whichever is earlier. A
contract liability is an entity’s obligation to transfer goods or services to the
customer for which the entity has received consideration (or for which the
amount is due) from the customer. When (or as) the entity transfers those
goods or services to the customer, the entity shall derecognise the contract
liability (or part of a contract liability) and recognise revenue, in accordance
with Step 5.
If an entity transfers goods or services to a customer before the customer has
paid (or before payment is due), the entity has a right to consideration. The
entity shall present that right as a contract asset, excluding any amounts
presented as a trade receivable (see paragraph 23.80). An entity shall assess a
contract asset for impairment and recognise and measure any impairment
loss in accordance with Section 11 Financial Instruments.
A receivable is an entity’s unconditional right to consideration. A right to
consideration is unconditional if only the passage of time is necessary before
payment of that consideration becomes due. An entity can have an
unconditional right to consideration even though it might be required to
refund the consideration in the future (for example, when a right of return
exists). In those instances, the entity might recognise a trade receivable and a
refund liability. An entity shall account for a trade receivable in accordance
with Section 11. An entity shall present trade receivables separately from
contract assets and contract liabilities in the statement of financial position.

 An entity is permitted to use different descriptions in the statement of
financial position for ‘contract assets’ and ‘contract liabilities’. If an entity
uses a different description for ‘contract assets’, the entity shall provide
enough information for a user of the financial statements to distinguish
between trade receivables and contract assets.
Disclosures
An entity shall disaggregate revenue from contracts with customers using
categories based on the characteristics of the entity’s revenue, contracts or
customers that are relevant to an understanding of its financial performance.
Examples of categories that might be appropriate include:
(a)
type of good or service (for example, major product lines);
(b)
geographical region (for example, country or region);
(c)
market or type of customer (for example, government and
non-government customers);
(d)
type of contract (for example, fixed-price and time-and-materials
contracts);
(e)
contract duration (for example, short-term and long-term contracts);
(f)
timing of transfer of goods or services (for example, revenue from
goods or services transferred to customers at a point in time and
revenue from goods or services transferred over time); and
(g)
nature of promise (for example, revenue from acting as a principal and
revenue from acting as an agent).
If not otherwise separately presented or disclosed, an entity shall disclose:
(a)
the opening and closing balances of trade receivables and contract
assets separately; and
(b)
total impairment losses recognised on trade receivables and contract
assets during the reporting period in accordance with Section 11.
An entity shall disclose:
(a)
the opening and closing balances of contract liabilities, if they are not
otherwise separately presented or disclosed; and
(b)
revenue recognised in the reporting period that was included in the
contract liability balance at the beginning of the period.
An entity shall disclose information about its promises in contracts with
customers, including a description of:
(a)
when the entity typically fulfils its promises (for example, upon
shipment, upon delivery, as services are rendered or upon completion
of service);
23.81
23.82
23.83
23.84
23.85

195
 (b)
the main payment terms (for example, when payment is typically due,
whether the contract constitutes a financing transaction and whether
the consideration includes a variable amount);
(c)
the nature of the goods or services that the entity has promised to
transfer to customers, highlighting any promises to arrange for
another party to transfer goods or services if the entity is an agent;
(d)
obligations for returns, refunds and other similar obligations; and
(e)
types of warranties and related obligations.
An entity shall disclose the methods it used to measure its progress towards
fulfilment of promises fulfilled over time (for example, a description of the
output or input methods it used and how those methods were applied).
An entity shall disclose any judgements it has made that had a significant
effect on the amounts it recognised in its financial statements when:
(a)
determining the transaction price; and
(b)
allocating the transaction price to the promises identified in the
contract.
An entity shall disclose the closing balance of assets arising from the costs to
fulfil a contract (in accordance with paragraph 23.70) by main category of
asset (for example, pre-contract costs and set-up costs).
If an entity chooses to use the option in paragraph 23.38 not to account for
interest revenue separately from revenue from contracts with customers, it
shall disclose that fact.
If an entity cannot account for an option to acquire additional goods or
services that meets the criteria in paragraph 23A.9(a) as a separate promise
without undue cost or effort, the entity shall disclose that fact and the reasons
why accounting for the option as a separate promise would involve undue cost
or effort.

 Appendix to Section 23
Application guidance
This appendix is an integral part of Section 23.
This guidance focuses on features found in some contracts with customers.
The guidance covers:
(a)
contract modifications (see paragraphs 23A.2–23A.4);
(b)
warranties (see paragraphs 23A.5–23A.7);
(c)
customer options for additional goods or services (see paragraphs
23A.8–23A.13);
(d)
principal versus agent considerations (see paragraphs 23A.14–23A.20);
(e)
non-cash consideration (see paragraphs 23A.21–23A.22);
(f)
sales with a right of return (see paragraphs 23A.23–23A.27); and
(g)
licensing (see paragraphs 23A.28–23A.37).
Contract modifications
A contract modification is a change in the scope or price (or both) of a contract
that the parties to the contract approve. A contract modification either
changes the existing rights and obligations in a contract or creates new ones.
An entity shall account for a contract modification as a separate contract if:
(a)
additional goods or services are promised that are distinct from those
in the original contract; and
(b)
the price of the original contract increases by an amount that reflects
the stand-alone selling price of the additional goods or services and any
appropriate change to that price to reflect the circumstances of the
modified contract.
For a contract modification that is not a separate contract in accordance with
paragraph 23A.3, an entity shall account for the contract modification in one
of two ways. If the goods or services an entity will transfer after the contract
modification are:
(a)
distinct from the goods or services the entity has transferred before the
contract modification, the entity shall account for the contract
modification as if the original contract had been cancelled and a new
contract created. The transaction price for the new contract is the sum
of:
(i)
the consideration included in the estimate of the transaction
price for the original contract that the entity did not recognise
as revenue; and
(ii)
any increase or decrease in consideration promised as part of
the contract modification.
23A.1
23A.2
23A.3
23A.4
IFRS FOR SMES ACCOUNTING STANDARD
© IFRS Foundation
197
 (b)
not distinct from the goods or services the entity has transferred before
the contract modification, the entity shall account for the contract
modification as if it had always been part of the original contract. The
entity shall recognise the change in the transaction price and the
entity’s measure of progress towards fulfilment of the promise as an
adjustment to revenue at the date of the contract modification (that is,
on a cumulative catch-up basis).
Warranties
An entity might sell a good or service with a warranty.
If a customer can choose to buy the good or service either with or without a
warranty, the warranty is distinct. In these circumstances, an entity shall
account for the warranty as a separate promise and allocate a portion of the
transaction price to that promise.
If the customer has no option to buy the good or service without a warranty,
the warranty is not distinct. In these circumstances, an entity shall account
for the warranty in accordance with Section 21 Provisions and Contingencies.
Customer options for additional goods or services
An entity might grant customers the option to acquire additional goods or
services for free or at a discount. Such options include sales incentives,
customer award credits (or points), contract renewal options or other
discounts on future goods or services.
An entity shall account for an option to acquire additional goods or services as
a separate promise if:
(a)
the option gives the customer a material right that:
(i)
is only available to a customer that has entered into that
contract; and
(ii)
allows a customer to acquire an additional good or service at a
discount to its stand-alone selling price; and
(b)
the option can be accounted for as a separate promise without undue
cost or effort.
To account for the option as a separate promise, the entity shall:
(a)
allocate a portion of the transaction price to the promise (see
paragraphs 23A.11–23A.13); and
(b)
recognise revenue when the entity transfers those future goods or
services or when the option expires.
In accordance with Step 4, an entity shall allocate the transaction price to
each promise in the contract on a relative stand-alone selling price basis. If the
stand-alone selling price is not directly observable, an entity shall estimate the
price. The estimate of the stand-alone selling price of an option shall reflect

 the discount that the customer would obtain when exercising the option,
adjusted for:
(a)
any discount that the customer could receive without exercising the
option; and
(b)
the likelihood that the customer exercises the option.
An entity might grant a customer an option to renew a contract on similar
terms. If the entity accounts for the renewal option as a separate promise, it
shall allocate the transaction price to the option based on the total expected
consideration allocated to the total goods or services it expects to transfer,
instead of estimating the stand-alone selling price of the option. The entity
shall include expected renewal period(s) when estimating the total goods or
services it expects to transfer and corresponding total expected consideration.
The amount of the transaction price allocated to the renewal option is the
difference between:
(a)
the transaction price for the original contract; and
(b)
the amount of the total expected consideration allocated to the goods
or services to be transferred under the original contract.
Principal versus agent considerations
If another party is involved in providing goods or services to a customer, an
entity shall determine whether its promise is to provide the specified goods or
services itself (that is, the entity is a principal) or to arrange for the other
party to provide those goods or services (that is, the entity is an agent).
To determine whether an entity is a principal or agent, the entity shall:
(a)
identify the specified goods or services to be provided to the customer
(see paragraph 23A.16); and
(b)
evaluate whether it controls each specified good or service before that
good or service is transferred to the customer (see paragraph 23A.18).
A specified good or service is a distinct good or service (or a distinct bundle of
goods or services) to be provided to the customer. A right to a future service to
be provided by another party might be a distinct good or service (for example,
a ticket that gives the customer the right to fly on a specified flight).
An entity is a principal if it controls the specified good or service before that
good or service is transferred to the customer.
An entity has control of a specified good or service if it has the present ability
to direct the use of that good or service and obtain the economic benefits that
might flow from it. Indicators that the entity controls the specified good or
service before it is transferred to a customer (and is therefore a principal)
include:

199
 (a)
the entity being primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to
transfer the specified good or service. This responsibility typically
includes responsibility for the acceptability of the specified good or
service.
(b)
the entity having inventory risk before or after the specified good or
service is transferred to the customer (for example, if the entity
commits to obtain the good or service before it is sold or accepts
responsibility for damaged or returned goods).
(c)
the entity having discretion to set the price for the specified good or
service.
A principal shall recognise as revenue the gross amount of the consideration it
expects to be entitled to in exchange for transferring the specified good or
service when (or as) it transfers control of that good or service to the
customer.
An entity that is an agent does not control the specified good or service
provided by another party before that good or service is transferred to the
customer. An agent shall recognise as revenue the amount of the fee or
commission it expects to be entitled to in exchange for arranging for another
party to provide the specified good or service as the agent fulfils its promise to
arrange the transfer of that good or service.
Non-cash consideration
The consideration promised by a customer might be in a form other than
cash, such as goods or services. An example is an exchange of goods in a barter
transaction.
An entity shall measure the non-cash consideration at fair value unless the
fair value cannot be reasonably estimated. If the entity cannot reasonably
estimate the fair value of the non-cash consideration, the entity shall instead
measure the consideration based on the stand-alone selling price of the goods
or services promised to the customer in exchange for the consideration.
Sales with a right of return
An entity might sell a product and give the customer the right to return the
product in exchange for any combination of:
(a)
a full or partial refund of any consideration paid;
(b)
a credit that can be applied against amounts owed, or that will be
owed, to the entity; or
(c)
another product.
To account for products sold with a right of return, an entity shall recognise:
(a)
revenue for consideration received or receivable for transferred
products the entity expects not to be returned;

23A.21
23A.22
23A.23
23A.24

 (b)
a refund liability for consideration received or receivable for
transferred products the entity expects to be returned; and
(c)
a returns asset for transferred products the entity expects to be
returned (and corresponding adjustment to cost of sales) classified as
inventory 
and 
measured 
in 
accordance 
with 
paragraphs
23A.26–23A.27.
Products an entity expects to be returned shall exclude:
(a)
products expected to be returned and exchanged for another of the
same type, quality, condition and price (for example, one colour or size
of product for another); and
(b)
defective products expected to be returned and exchanged for
functioning products.
An entity shall initially measure the returns asset at the former carrying
amount of the products the entity expects to be returned minus:
(a)
any expected costs to recover those products; and
(b)
any allowances for possible decreases in the value of those products
(for example, because of damage, obsolescence or declining selling
prices).
At the end of each reporting period, an entity shall adjust the refund liability
and returns asset for changes in its expectations about products to be
returned. The entity shall recognise adjustments to:
(a)
the refund liability in revenue; and
(b)
the returns asset as an expense.
Licensing
A licence gives a customer rights to an entity’s intellectual property (such as
software, technology, trademarks, patents, franchises, music and motion
picture films).
If a contract with a customer includes a licence (or licences) and other goods
or services, an entity shall apply Step 2 to identify each of the promises in the
contract. If the licence is not distinct from the other goods or services in the
contract, an entity shall apply Step 5 to determine whether the promise to
grant the licence is fulfilled over time or at a point in time. If the licence is
distinct from the other goods or services in the contract, an entity shall apply
paragraphs 23A.30–23A.36 to determine whether the promise to grant the
licence is fulfilled over time or at a point in time.
To determine whether the promise to grant a licence is fulfilled over time or
at a point in time, an entity shall consider whether the licence gives the
customer either:
(a)
a right to access the entity’s intellectual property as it exists
throughout the licence period, in which case the entity fulfils the
promise (and recognises revenue) over time; or
23A.25
23A.26
23A.27
23A.28
23A.29
23A.30
IFRS FOR SMES ACCOUNTING STANDARD
© IFRS Foundation
201
 (b)
a right to use the entity’s intellectual property as it exists at the point
in time at which the licence is granted, in which case the entity fulfils
the promise (and recognises revenue) at a point in time.
A licence gives a customer a right to access an entity’s intellectual property if
the entity expects to undertake activities:
(a)
that will substantively affect the customer’s benefit from the
intellectual property by changing the intellectual property’s substance
(see paragraph 23A.33); or
(b)
that could substantively affect the customer’s benefit from the
intellectual property by directly exposing the customer to any positive
or negative effects of those activities (see paragraph 23A.34).
An entity’s expected activities might be included in the terms of a contract or
might be activities that a customer reasonably expects the entity will
undertake. For the purpose of applying the criteria in paragraph 23A.31, the
entity shall exclude activities that result in the transfer of a good or service to
the customer.
Activities undertaken by the entity that change the intellectual property’s
substance include activities that change the intellectual property’s design,
content or ability to do a function or task (for example, development activities
that change the content to which the customer has rights).
Activities undertaken by the entity that directly expose the customer to
positive or negative effects include activities that support or maintain the
value of intellectual property (for example, ongoing activities that maintain
the value of the brand to which the customer has rights).
If either criterion in paragraph 23A.31 is met, the promise to grant a licence is
fulfilled over time. Otherwise, the promise is fulfilled at a point in time.
If a promise to grant a licence is fulfilled over time, an entity shall apply
paragraphs 23.62–23.67 to choose an appropriate method to measure its
progress towards fulfilment of that promise. If a promise to grant a licence is
fulfilled at a point in time, an entity shall apply paragraphs 23.57–23.61 to
identify the point in time the licence transfers to the customer, which cannot
be before the customer is able to use and benefit from the licence.
Sales-based or usage-based royalties
An entity might grant a licence of intellectual property in exchange for a
royalty based on sales or use. If the licence is the sole or main item to which
the royalty relates, the entity shall recognise revenue for such a royalty when
(or as) the later of two events happens:
(a)
the promise to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has
been fulfilled (or partially fulfilled); or
(b)
the subsequent sale or use takes place.

 Section 24
Government Grants
Scope of this section
This section specifies the accounting for all government grants. A
government grant is assistance by government in the form of a transfer of
resources to an entity in return for past or future compliance with certain
conditions relating to the operating activities of the entity.
Government grants exclude those forms of government assistance that cannot
reasonably have a value placed upon them and transactions with government
that cannot be distinguished from the normal trading transactions of the
entity.
This section does not cover government assistance that is provided for an
entity in the form of benefits that are available in determining taxable profit
or tax loss, or are determined or limited on the basis of income tax liability.
Examples of such benefits are income tax holidays, investment tax credits,
accelerated depreciation allowances and reduced income tax rates. Section 29
Income Tax covers accounting for taxes based on income.
Recognition and measurement
An entity shall recognise government grants as follows:
(a)
a grant that does not impose specified future performance conditions
on the recipient is recognised in income when the grant proceeds are
receivable;
(b)
a grant that imposes specified future performance conditions on the
recipient is recognised in income only when the performance
conditions are met; and
(c)
grants received before the revenue recognition criteria are satisfied
are recognised as a liability.
An entity shall measure grants at the fair value of the asset received or
receivable.
Disclosures
An entity shall disclose the following:
(a)
the nature and amounts of government grants recognised in the
financial statements;
(b)
unfulfilled 
conditions 
and 
other 
contingencies 
attaching 
to
government grants that have not been recognised in income; and
(c)
an indication of other forms of government assistance from which the
entity has directly benefited.

 Section 25
Borrowing Costs
Scope of this section
This section specifies the accounting for borrowing costs. Borrowing costs are
interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the
borrowing of funds. Borrowing costs include:
(a)
interest expense calculated using the effective interest method as
described in Section 11 Financial Instruments;
(b)
finance charges in respect of finance leases recognised in accordance
with Section 20 Leases; and
(c)
exchange differences arising from foreign currency borrowings to the
extent that they are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs.
Recognition
An entity shall recognise all borrowing costs as an expense in profit or loss in
the period in which they are incurred.
Disclosures
Paragraph 5.5(b) requires disclosure of finance costs. Paragraph 11.48(b)
requires disclosure of total interest expense (using the effective interest
method) for financial liabilities that are not at fair value through profit or
loss. This section does not require any additional disclosure.

 Section 26
Share-based Payment
Scope of this section
This section specifies the accounting for all share-based payment
transactions including those that are equity- or cash-settled or those in which
the terms of the arrangement provide a choice of whether the entity settles
the transaction in cash (or other assets) or by issuing equity instruments.
A share-based payment transaction may be settled by another group entity (or
a shareholder of any group entity) on behalf of the entity receiving the goods
or services. This section also applies to an entity that:
(a)
receives goods or services when another entity in the same group (or a
shareholder of any group entity) has the obligation to settle the
share-based payment transaction; or
(b)
has an obligation to settle a share-based payment transaction when
another entity in the same group receives the goods or services
unless the transaction is clearly for a purpose other than the payment for
goods or services supplied to the entity receiving them.
In the absence of specifically identifiable goods or services, other
circumstances may indicate that goods or services have been (or will be)
received, in which case this section applies (see paragraph 26.17).
This section does not apply to share-based payment transactions in which an
entity acquires goods as part of the net assets acquired in:
(a)
a business combination as defined in Section 19 Business Combinations
and Goodwill;
(b)
a combination of entities or businesses under common control as
described in paragraph 19.2; or
(c)
the contribution of a business on the formation of a jointly controlled
entity as defined in Section 15 Joint Arrangements.
Therefore, equity instruments issued in a business combination in exchange
for control of the acquiree are not within the scope of this section. However,
equity instruments granted to employees of the acquiree in their capacity as
employees (for example, in return for continued service) are within the scope
of this section. Similarly, the cancellation, replacement or other modification
of share-based payment arrangements because of a business combination or
other equity restructuring shall be accounted for in accordance with this
section.
This section uses the term ‘fair value’ in a way that differs in some respects
from the definition in the Glossary and in other sections of this Standard.
When applying this section, an entity shall apply the definition of fair value in
paragraph 26.1E and measure fair value in accordance with this section, not
Section 12 Fair Value Measurement.

 For the purpose of this section, fair value is the amount for which an asset
could be exchanged, a liability settled, or an equity instrument granted could
be exchanged, between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm’s length
transaction.
Cash-settled share-based payment transactions include share appreciation
rights. For example, an entity might grant share appreciation rights to
employees as part of their remuneration package, whereby the employees will
become entitled to a future cash payment (instead of an equity instrument),
based on the increase in the entity’s share price from a specified level over a
specified period of time. Or an entity might grant to its employees a right to
receive a future cash payment by granting to them a right to shares (including
shares to be issued upon the exercise of share options) that are redeemable,
either mandatorily (for example, upon cessation of employment) or at the
employee’s option.
Recognition
An entity shall recognise the goods or services received or acquired in a share-
based payment transaction when it obtains the goods or as the services are
received. The entity shall recognise a corresponding increase in equity if the
goods or services were received in an equity-settled share-based payment
transaction or a liability if the goods or services were acquired in a
cash-settled share-based payment transaction.
When the goods or services received or acquired in a share-based payment
transaction do not qualify for recognition as assets, the entity shall recognise
them as expenses.
Recognition when there are vesting conditions
If the share-based payments granted to an employee or another party (the
counterparty) vest immediately, the counterparty is not required to complete
a specified period of service before becoming unconditionally entitled to those
share-based payments. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the entity
shall presume that services rendered by the counterparty as consideration for
the share-based payments have been received. In this case, on the grant date
the entity shall recognise the services received in full, with a corresponding
increase in equity or liabilities.
If the share-based payments do not vest until the counterparty completes a
specified period of service, the entity shall presume that the services to be
rendered by the counterparty as consideration for those share-based payments
will be received in the future, during the vesting period. The entity shall
account for those services as they are rendered by the counterparty during the
vesting period, with a corresponding increase in equity or liabilities.

 Measurement of equity-settled share-based payment transactions
Measurement principle
For equity-settled share-based payment transactions, an entity shall measure
the goods or services received, and the corresponding increase in equity, at the
fair value of the goods or services received, unless that fair value cannot be
estimated reliably. If the entity cannot estimate reliably the fair value of the
goods or services received, the entity shall measure their value, and the
corresponding increase in equity, by reference to the fair value of the equity
instruments granted. To apply this requirement to transactions with
employees and others providing similar services, the entity shall measure the
fair value of the services received by reference to the fair value of the equity
instruments granted, because typically it is not possible to estimate reliably
the fair value of the services received.
For transactions with employees and others providing similar services,6 the
fair value of the equity instruments shall be measured at the grant date. For
transactions with parties other than employees, the measurement date is the
date when the entity obtains the goods or the counterparty renders service.
A grant of equity instruments might be conditional upon satisfying specified
vesting conditions related to service or performance. An example of a service
condition is when a grant of shares or share options to an employee is
conditional on the employee remaining in the entity’s employ for a specified
period of time. Examples of performance conditions are when a grant of
shares or share options is conditional on a specified period of service and on
the entity achieving a specified growth in profit (a non-market vesting
condition) or a specified increase in the entity’s share price (a market vesting
condition). Vesting conditions and conditions that are not vesting conditions
(non-vesting conditions) are accounted for as follows:
(a)
service conditions and non-market vesting conditions shall be taken
into account when estimating the number of equity instruments
expected to vest and subsequently adjusting the number of equity
instruments included in the measurement of the transaction amount.
The entity shall initially recognise an amount for the goods or services
received during the vesting period based on the number of equity
instruments that are expected to vest. The entity shall revise that
estimate if new information indicates that the number of equity
instruments expected to vest differs from previous estimates. On the
vesting date, the entity shall revise the estimate to equal the number
of equity instruments that ultimately vested. Service conditions and
non-market vesting conditions shall not be taken into account when
estimating the fair value of the shares, share options or other equity
instruments at the measurement date.

In the rest of this section, all references to employees also include others providing similar
services.

© IFRS Foundation
 (b)
market vesting conditions and non-vesting conditions shall be taken
into account when estimating the fair value of the shares, share
options or other equity instruments at the measurement date, with no
subsequent adjustment to the estimated fair value, irrespective of the
outcome of the market vesting conditions and non-vesting conditions,
provided that all other vesting conditions are satisfied.
Shares
An entity shall measure the fair value of shares (and the related goods or
services received) using the following three-tier measurement hierarchy:
(a)
if an observable market price is available for the equity instruments
granted, use that price.
(b)
if an observable market price is not available, measure the fair value of
equity instruments granted using entity-specific observable market
data such as:
(i)
a recent transaction in the entity’s shares; or
(ii)
a recent independent fair valuation of the entity or its principal
assets.
(c)
if an observable market price is not available and obtaining a reliable
measurement of fair value under (b) is impracticable, indirectly
measure the fair value of the shares using a valuation method that
uses market data to the greatest extent practicable to estimate what
the price of those equity instruments would be on the grant date in an
arm’s length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties. The
entity’s directors should use their judgement to apply the most
appropriate valuation method to determine fair value. Any valuation
method used shall be consistent with generally accepted valuation
methodologies for valuing equity instruments.
Share options and equity-settled share appreciation
rights
An entity shall measure the fair value of share options and equity-settled
share appreciation rights (and the related goods or services received) using the
following three-tier measurement hierarchy:
(a)
if an observable market price is available for the equity instruments
granted, use that price.
(b)
if an observable market price is not available, measure the fair value of
share 
options 
and 
share 
appreciation 
rights 
granted 
using
entity-specific observable market data such as (a) for a recent
transaction in the share options.
(c)
if an observable market price is not available and obtaining a reliable
measurement of fair value under (b) is impracticable, indirectly
measure the fair value of share options or share appreciation rights
using an option pricing model. The inputs for the model (such as the
26.10
26.11
IFRS FOR SMES ACCOUNTING STANDARD
© IFRS Foundation
209
 weighted average share price, exercise price, expected volatility, option
life, expected dividends and the risk-free interest rate) shall use market
data to the greatest extent possible. Paragraph 26.10 provides guidance
on determining the fair value of the shares used in determining the
weighted average share price. The entity shall derive an estimate of
expected volatility consistent with the valuation methodology used to
determine the fair value of the shares.
Modifications to the terms and conditions on which
equity instruments were granted
An entity might modify the terms and conditions on which equity
instruments are granted in a manner that is beneficial to the employee, for
example, by reducing the exercise price of an option or reducing the vesting
period or by modifying or eliminating a performance condition. Alternatively
an entity might modify the terms and conditions in a manner that is not
beneficial to the employee, for example, by increasing the vesting period or
adding a performance condition. The entity shall take the modified vesting
conditions into account in accounting for the share-based payment
transaction, as follows:
(a)
if the modification increases the fair value of the equity instruments
granted (or increases the number of equity instruments granted)
measured immediately before and after the modification, the entity
shall include the incremental fair value granted in the measurement of
the amount recognised for services received as consideration for the
equity instruments granted. The incremental fair value granted is the
difference between the fair value of the modified equity instrument
and that of the original equity instrument, both estimated as at the
date of the modification. If the modification occurs during the vesting
period, the incremental fair value granted is included in the
measurement of the amount recognised for services received over the
period from the modification date until the date when the modified
equity instruments vest, in addition to the amount based on the grant
date fair value of the original equity instruments, which is recognised
over the remainder of the original vesting period.
(b)
if the modification reduces the total fair value of the share-based
payment arrangement, or apparently is not otherwise beneficial to the
employee, the entity shall nevertheless continue to account for the
services received as consideration for the equity instruments granted
as if that modification had not occurred.
The requirements in this paragraph are expressed in the context of
share-based payment transactions with employees. The requirements also
apply to share-based payment transactions with parties other than employees
if these transactions are measured by reference to the fair value of the equity
instruments granted, but reference to the grant date refers to the date that
the entity obtains the goods or the counterparty renders service.
26.12

 Cancellations and settlements
An entity shall account for a cancellation or settlement of an equity-settled
share-based payment award as an acceleration of vesting, and therefore shall
recognise immediately the amount that otherwise would have been
recognised for services received over the remainder of the vesting period.
Cash-settled share-based payment transactions
For cash-settled share-based payment transactions, an entity shall measure the
goods or services acquired and the liability incurred at the fair value of the
liability. Until the liability is settled, the entity shall remeasure the fair value
of the liability at each reporting date and at the date of settlement, with any
changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss for the period.
A cash-settled share-based payment transaction might be conditional upon
satisfying specified vesting conditions related to service or performance.
Vesting conditions and conditions that are not vesting conditions (non-vesting
conditions) are accounted for as follows:
(a)
service conditions and non-market vesting conditions shall be taken
into account when estimating the number of awards that are expected
to vest and subsequently adjusting the number of awards included in
the measurement of the liability arising from the transaction. The
entity shall initially recognise an amount for the goods or services
received during the vesting period based on the number of awards that
are expected to vest. The entity shall revise that estimate if new
information indicates that the number of awards expected to vest
differs from previous estimates. On the vesting date, the entity shall
revise the estimate to equal the number of awards that ultimately
vested. Service conditions and non-market vesting conditions shall not
be taken into account when estimating the fair value of the
cash-settled share-based payment at the measurement date.
(b)
market vesting conditions and non-vesting conditions shall be taken
into account when estimating the fair value of the cash-settled
share-based payment granted and when remeasuring the fair value of
the liability at the end of each reporting period and at the date of
settlement.
As a result of applying paragraph 26.14A, the cumulative amount ultimately
recognised for goods or services received as consideration for the cash-settled
share-based payment is equal to the cash paid.
Share-based payment transactions with cash alternatives
Some share-based payment transactions give either the entity or the
counterparty a choice of settling the transaction in cash (or other assets) or by
transfer of equity instruments. In such a case, the entity shall account for the
transaction as a cash-settled share-based payment transaction unless:
(a)
the entity has a past practice of settling by issuing equity instruments;
26.13
26.14
26.14A
26.14B
26.15
IFRS FOR SMES ACCOUNTING STANDARD
© IFRS Foundation
211
 (b)
the option has no commercial substance because the cash settlement
amount bears no relationship to, and is likely to be lower in value
than, the fair value of the equity instrument; or
(c)
the choice of settlement relates only to a net settlement feature (see
paragraph 26.15A) and the transaction satisfies the conditions in
paragraph 26.15B.
In circumstances (a) and (b), the entity shall account for the transaction as an
equity-settled share-based payment transaction in accordance with paragraphs
26.7–26.13. In circumstance (c), the entity shall account for the transaction in
accordance with paragraphs 26.15B–26.15D.
Share-based payment transactions with a net settlement feature
for withholding tax obligations
Tax laws or regulations might oblige an entity to withhold an amount for an
employee’s tax obligation associated with a share-based payment and transfer
that amount, normally in cash, to the tax authority on the employee’s behalf.
A share-based payment arrangement has a net settlement feature if the terms
of the arrangement require or permit an entity to withhold the number of
equity instruments equal to the monetary value of the employee’s tax
obligation from the total number of equity instruments that otherwise would
have been issued to the employee upon exercise (or vesting) of the share-based
payment.
The share-based payment transaction described in paragraph 26.15A shall be
classified as an equity-settled share-based payment transaction if:
(a)
it would have been so classified in the absence of the net settlement
feature; and
(b)
there is an obligation on the entity under tax laws or regulations to
withhold an amount for an employee’s tax obligation associated with
that share-based payment.
For a transaction that satisfies the conditions in paragraph 26.15B, an entity
shall account for the payment to the tax authority as a deduction from equity
for the equity instruments withheld, except to the extent that the payment
exceeds the fair value at the net settlement date of the equity instruments
withheld.
Paragraph 26.15B does not apply to any equity instruments that the entity
withholds in excess of the monetary value of the employee’s tax obligation
associated with the share-based payment. Such excess shares withheld shall be
accounted for as a cash-settled share-based payment when this amount is paid
in cash (or other assets) to the employee.

 Group plans
If a share-based payment award is granted by an entity for goods or services
received by one or more group entities, and the group presents consolidated
financial statements using either the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard or
full IFRS Accounting Standards, the group entities are permitted, as an
alternative to the treatment set out in paragraphs 26.3–26.15D, to measure
the share-based payment expense on the basis of a reasonable allocation of the
expense for the group.
Unidentifiable goods or services
If the identifiable consideration received appears to be less than the fair value
of the equity instruments granted or the liability incurred, this situation
typically indicates that other consideration (ie unidentifiable goods or services)
has been (or will be) received. For example, some jurisdictions have
programmes by which owners (such as employees) are able to acquire equity
without providing goods or services that can be specifically identified (or by
providing goods or services that are clearly less than the fair value of the
equity instruments granted). This indicates that other consideration has been
or will be received (such as past or future employee services). The entity shall
measure the unidentifiable goods or services received (or to be received) as the
difference between the fair value of the share-based payment and the fair
value of any identifiable goods or services received (or to be received)
measured at the grant date. For cash-settled transactions, the liability shall be
remeasured at the end of each reporting period until it is settled in accordance
with paragraph 26.14.
Disclosures
An entity shall disclose the following information about the nature and extent
of share-based payment arrangements that existed during the period:
(a)
a description of each type of share-based payment arrangement that
existed at any time during the period, including the general terms and
conditions of each arrangement, such as vesting requirements, the
maximum term of options granted, and the method of settlement (for
example, whether in cash or equity). An entity with substantially
similar types of share-based payment arrangements may aggregate this
information.
(b)
the number and weighted average exercise prices of share options for
each of the following groups of options:
(i)
outstanding at the beginning of the period;
(ii)
granted during the period;
(iii)
forfeited during the period;
(iv)
exercised during the period;
(v)
expired during the period;
26.16

© IFRS Foundation
213
 (vi)
outstanding at the end of the period; and
(vii)
exercisable at the end of the period.
For equity-settled share-based payment arrangements, an entity shall disclose
information about how it measured the fair value of goods or services received
or the value of the equity instruments granted. If a valuation methodology
was used, the entity shall disclose the method and its reason for choosing it.
For cash-settled share-based payment arrangements, an entity shall disclose
information about how the liability was measured.
For share-based payment arrangements that were modified during the period,
an entity shall disclose an explanation of those modifications.
If the entity is part of a group share-based payment plan, and it measures its
share-based payment expense on the basis of a reasonable allocation of the
expense recognised for the group, it shall disclose that fact and the basis for
the allocation (see paragraph 26.16).
An entity shall disclose the following information about the effect of
share-based payment transactions on the entity’s profit or loss for the period
and on its financial position:
(a)
the total expense recognised in profit or loss for the period; and
(b)
the total carrying amount at the end of the period for liabilities
arising from share-based payment transactions.

 Section 27
Impairment of Assets
Objective and scope
An impairment loss occurs when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its
recoverable amount. This section shall be applied in accounting for the
impairment of all assets other than the following, for which other sections of
this Standard establish impairment requirements:
(a)
deferred tax assets (see Section 29 Income Tax);
(b)
assets arising from employee benefits (see Section 28 Employee Benefits);
(c)
financial assets within the scope of Section 11 Financial Instruments;
(d)
investment property measured at fair value (see Section 16 Investment
Property);
(e)
biological assets related to agricultural activity measured at fair value
less estimated costs to sell (see Section 34 Specialised Activities); and
(f)
contract assets and assets arising from the costs of fulfilling a contract
with a customer in accordance with paragraph 23.70.
Impairment of inventories
Selling price less costs to complete and sell
An entity shall assess at each reporting date whether any inventories are
impaired. The entity shall make the assessment by comparing the carrying
amount of each item of inventory (or group of similar items—see
paragraph 27.3) with its selling price less costs to complete and sell. If an item
of inventory (or group of similar items) is impaired, the entity shall reduce the
carrying amount of the inventory (or the group) to its selling price less costs to
complete and sell. That reduction is an impairment loss and it is recognised
immediately in profit or loss.
If it is impracticable to determine the selling price less costs to complete and
sell for inventories item by item, the entity may group items of inventory
relating to the same product line that have similar purposes or end uses and
are produced and marketed in the same geographical area for the purpose of
assessing impairment.
Reversal of impairment
An entity shall make a new assessment of selling price less costs to complete
and sell at each subsequent reporting date. When the circumstances that
previously caused inventories to be impaired no longer exist or when there is
clear evidence of an increase in selling price less costs to complete and sell
because of changed economic circumstances, the entity shall reverse the
amount of the impairment (ie the reversal is limited to the amount of the
27.1
27.2
27.3
27.4
IFRS FOR SMES ACCOUNTING STANDARD
© IFRS Foundation
215
 original impairment loss) so that the new carrying amount is the lower of the
cost and the revised selling price less costs to complete and sell.
Impairment of assets other than inventories
General principles
If, and only if, the recoverable amount of an asset is less than its carrying
amount, the entity shall reduce the carrying amount of the asset to its
recoverable amount. That reduction is an impairment loss. Paragraphs
27.11–27.20 provide guidance on measuring recoverable amount.
An entity shall recognise an impairment loss immediately in profit or loss,
unless the asset is carried at a revalued amount in accordance with the
revaluation model in Section 17 Property, Plant and Equipment. Any impairment
loss of a revalued asset shall be treated as a revaluation decrease in accordance
with paragraph 17.15D.
Indicators of impairment
An entity shall assess at each reporting date whether there is any indication
that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the entity shall
estimate the recoverable amount of the asset. If there is no indication of
impairment, it is not necessary to estimate the recoverable amount.
If it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of the individual asset,
an entity shall estimate the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit
to which the asset belongs. This may be the case because measuring
recoverable amount requires forecasting cash flows and sometimes individual
assets do not generate cash flows by themselves. An asset’s cash-generating
unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that includes the asset and
generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from
other assets or groups of assets.
In assessing whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired, an
entity shall consider, as a minimum, the following indications:
External sources of information
(a)
during the period, an asset’s market value has declined significantly
more than would be expected as a result of the passage of time or
normal use.
(b)
significant changes with an adverse effect on the entity have taken
place during the period, or will take place in the near future, in the
technological, market, economic or legal environment in which the
entity operates or in the market to which an asset is dedicated.
(c)
market interest rates or other market rates of return on investments
have increased during the period, and those increases are likely to
affect materially the discount rate used in calculating an asset’s value
in use and decrease the asset’s fair value less costs to sell.
27.5
27.6
27.7
27.8
27.9
FEBRUARY 2025
216
© IFRS Foundation
 (d)
the carrying amount of the net assets of the entity is more than the
estimated fair value of the entity as a whole (such an estimate may
have been made, for example, in relation to the potential sale of part
or all of the entity).
Internal sources of information
(e)
evidence is available of obsolescence or physical damage of an asset.
(f)
significant changes with an adverse effect on the entity have taken
place during the period, or are expected to take place in the near
future, in the extent to which, or manner in which, an asset is used or
is expected to be used. These changes include the asset becoming idle,
plans to discontinue or restructure the operation to which an asset
belongs and plans to dispose of an asset before the previously expected
date.
(g)
evidence is available from internal reporting that indicates that the
economic performance of an asset is, or will be, worse than expected.
In this context economic performance includes operating results and
cash flows.
If there is an indication that an asset may be impaired, this may indicate that
the entity should review the remaining useful life, the depreciation
(amortisation) method or the residual value for the asset and adjust it in
accordance with the section of this Standard applicable to the asset (for
example, Section 17 and Section 18 Intangible Assets other than Goodwill), even if
no impairment loss is recognised for the asset.
Measuring recoverable amount
The recoverable amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit is the higher of
its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. If it is not possible to
estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, references in
paragraphs 27.12–27.20 to an asset should be read as references also to an
asset’s cash-generating unit.
It is not always necessary to determine both an asset’s fair value less costs to
sell and its value in use. If either of these amounts exceeds the asset’s carrying
amount, the asset is not impaired and it is not necessary to estimate the other
amount.
If there is no reason to believe that an asset’s value in use materially exceeds
its fair value less costs to sell, the asset’s fair value less costs to sell may be
used as its recoverable amount. This will often be the case for an asset that is
held for disposal.
Fair value less costs to sell
When measuring fair value less costs to sell, an entity shall apply the
guidance on measuring fair value in Section 12 Fair Value Measurement and
deduct the costs of disposal.

 Value in use
Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be
derived from an asset. This present value calculation involves the following
steps:
(a)
estimating the future cash inflows and outflows to be derived from
continuing use of the asset and from its ultimate disposal; and
(b)
applying the appropriate discount rate to those future cash flows.
The following elements shall be reflected in the calculation of an asset’s value
in use:
(a)
an estimate of the future cash flows the entity expects to derive from
the asset;
(b)
expectations about possible variations in the amount or timing of
those future cash flows;
(c)
the time value of money, represented by the current market risk-free
rate of interest;
(d)
the price for bearing the uncertainty inherent in the asset; and
(e)
other factors, such as illiquidity, that market participants would
reflect in pricing the future cash flows the entity expects to derive
from the asset.
In measuring value in use, estimates of future cash flows shall include:
(a)
projections of cash inflows from the continuing use of the asset;
(b)
projections of cash outflows that are necessarily incurred to generate
the cash inflows from continuing use of the asset (including cash
outflows to prepare the asset for use) and can be directly attributed, or
allocated on a reasonable and consistent basis, to the asset; and
(c)
net cash flows, if any, expected to be received (or paid) for the disposal
of the asset at the end of its useful life in an arm’s length transaction
between knowledgeable, willing parties.
The entity may wish to use any recent financial budgets or forecasts to
estimate the cash flows, if available. To estimate cash flow projections beyond
the period covered by the most recent budgets or forecasts an entity may wish
to extrapolate the projections based on the budgets or forecasts using a steady
or declining growth rate for subsequent years, unless an increasing rate can be
justified.
Estimates of future cash flows shall not include:
(a)
cash inflows or outflows from financing activities; or
(b)
income tax receipts or payments.
Future cash flows shall be estimated for the asset in its current condition.
Estimates of future cash flows shall not include estimated future cash inflows
or outflows that are expected to arise from:
27.15

27.17
27.18
27.19
FEBRUARY 2025
218
© IFRS Foundation
 (a)
a future restructuring to which an entity is not yet committed; or
(b)
improving or enhancing the asset’s performance.
The discount rate (rates) used in the present value calculation shall be a
pre-tax rate (rates) that reflect(s) current market assessments of:
(a)
the time value of money; and
(b)
the risks specific to the asset for which the future cash flow estimates
have not been adjusted.
The discount rate (rates) used to measure an asset’s value in use shall not
reflect risks for which the future cash flow estimates have been adjusted, to
avoid double-counting.
Recognising and measuring an impairment loss for a
cash-generating unit
An impairment loss shall be recognised for a cash-generating unit if, and only
if, the recoverable amount of the unit is less than the carrying amount of the
unit. The impairment loss shall be allocated to reduce the carrying amount of
the assets of the unit in the following order:
(a)
first, to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the
cash-generating unit; and
(b)
then, to the other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the
carrying amount of each asset in the cash-generating unit.
However, an entity shall not reduce the carrying amount of any asset in the
cash-generating unit below the highest of:
(a)
its fair value less costs to sell (if determinable);
(b)
its value in use (if determinable); and
(c)
zero.
Any excess amount of the impairment loss that cannot be allocated to an asset
because of the restriction in paragraph 27.22 shall be allocated to the other
assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of those other
assets.
Additional requirements for impairment of goodwill
Goodwill, by itself, cannot be sold. Nor does it generate cash flows to an entity
that are independent of the cash flows of other assets. As a consequence, the
fair value of goodwill cannot be measured directly. Consequently, the fair
value of goodwill must be derived from measurement of the fair value of the
cash-generating unit(s) of which the goodwill is a part.

 For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business
combination shall, from the acquisition date, be allocated to each of the
acquirer’s cash-generating units that is expected to benefit from the synergies
of the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the
acquiree are assigned to those units.
Part of the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is attributable to the
non-controlling interest in goodwill. For the purpose of impairment testing a
non-wholly-owned cash-generating unit with goodwill, the carrying amount of
that unit is notionally adjusted, before being compared with its recoverable
amount, by grossing up the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to the unit
to include the goodwill attributable to the non-controlling interest. This
notionally adjusted carrying amount is then compared with the recoverable
amount of the unit to determine whether the cash-generating unit is
impaired.
If goodwill cannot be allocated to individual cash-generating units (or groups
of cash-generating units) on a non-arbitrary basis, then for the purposes of
testing goodwill the entity shall test the impairment of goodwill by
determining the recoverable amount of either:
(a)
the acquired entity in its entirety, if the goodwill relates to an acquired
entity that has not been integrated (integrated means the acquired
business has been restructured or dissolved into the reporting entity
or other subsidiaries); or
(b)
the entire group of entities, excluding any entities that have not been
integrated, if the goodwill relates to an entity that has been integrated.
In applying this paragraph, an entity will need to separate goodwill into
goodwill relating to entities that have been integrated and goodwill relating to
entities that have not been integrated. Also the entity shall follow the
requirements for cash-generating units in this section when calculating the
recoverable amount of, and allocating impairment losses and reversals to
assets belonging to, the acquired entity or group of entities.
Reversal of an impairment loss
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill shall not be reversed in a
subsequent period.
For all assets other than goodwill, an entity shall assess at each reporting date
whether there is any indication that an impairment loss recognised in prior
periods may no longer exist or may have decreased. Indications that an
impairment loss may have decreased or may no longer exist are generally the
opposite of those set out in paragraph 27.9. If any such indication exists, the
entity shall determine whether all or part of the prior impairment loss should
be reversed. The procedure for making that determination will depend on
whether the prior impairment loss on the asset was based on:
(a)
the recoverable amount of that individual asset (see paragraph 27.30);
or
27.25
27.26
27.27
27.28
27.29

 (b)
the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset
belongs (see paragraph 27.31).
Reversal where recoverable amount was estimated for an
individual impaired asset
When the prior impairment loss was based on the recoverable amount of the
individual impaired asset, the following requirements apply:
(a)
the entity shall estimate the recoverable amount of the asset at the
current reporting date.
(b)
if the estimated recoverable amount of the asset exceeds its carrying
amount, the entity shall increase the carrying amount to recoverable
amount, subject to the limitation described in (c). That increase is a
reversal of an impairment loss. The entity shall recognise the reversal
immediately in profit or loss, unless the asset is carried at a revalued
amount 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
revaluation 
model 
in
paragraph 17.15B. Any reversal of an impairment loss of a revalued
asset shall be treated as a revaluation increase in accordance with
paragraph 17.15C.
(c)
the reversal of an impairment loss shall not increase the carrying
amount of the asset above the carrying amount that would have been
determined (net of amortisation or depreciation) had no impairment
loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
(d)
after a reversal of an impairment loss is recognised, the entity shall
adjust the depreciation (amortisation) charge for the asset in future
periods to allocate the asset’s revised carrying amount, less its residual
value (if any), on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.
Reversal when recoverable amount was estimated for a
cash-generating unit
When the original impairment loss was based on the recoverable amount of
the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs, the following
requirements apply:
(a)
the entity shall estimate the recoverable amount of that cash-
generating unit at the current reporting date.
(b)
if the estimated recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit
exceeds its carrying amount, that excess is a reversal of an impairment
loss. The entity shall allocate the amount of that reversal to the assets
of the unit, except for goodwill, pro rata with the carrying amounts of
those assets, subject to the limitation described in (c). Those increases
in carrying amounts shall be treated as reversals of impairment losses
for individual assets and be recognised immediately in profit or loss,
unless the asset is carried at a revalued amount in accordance with the
revaluation model in paragraph 17.15B. Any reversal of an impairment
loss of a revalued asset shall be treated as a revaluation increase in
accordance with paragraph 17.15C.

221
 (c)
in allocating a reversal of an impairment loss for a cash-generating
unit, the reversal shall not increase the carrying amount of any asset
above the lower of:
(i)
its recoverable amount; and
(ii)
the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of
amortisation or depreciation) had no impairment loss been
recognised for the asset in prior periods.
(d)
any excess amount of the reversal of the impairment loss that cannot
be allocated to an asset because of the restriction in (c) shall be
allocated pro rata to the other assets of the cash-generating unit,
except for goodwill.
(e)
after a reversal of an impairment loss is recognised, if applicable, the
entity shall adjust the depreciation (amortisation) charge for each asset
in the cash-generating unit in future periods to allocate the asset’s
revised carrying amount, less its residual value (if any), on a systematic
basis over its remaining useful life.
Disclosures
An entity shall disclose the following for each class of assets indicated in
paragraph 27.33:
(a)
the amount of impairment losses recognised in profit or loss during
the period and the line item(s) in the statement of comprehensive
income (and in the income statement, if presented) in which those
impairment losses are included; and
(b)
the amount of reversals of impairment losses recognised in profit or
loss during the period and the line item(s) in the statement of
comprehensive income (and in the income statement, if presented) in
which those impairment losses are reversed.
An entity shall disclose the information required by paragraph 27.32 for each
of the following classes of asset:
(a)
inventories;
(b)
property, plant and equipment (including investment property
accounted for by the cost model);
(c)
goodwill;
(d)
intangible assets other than goodwill;
(e)
investments in associates; and
(f)
investments in jointly controlled entities.

 Section 28
Employee Benefits
Scope of this section
Employee benefits are all forms of consideration given by an entity in
exchange for service rendered by employees, including directors and
management. This section applies to all employee benefits, except for
share-based payment transactions, which are covered by Section 26
Share-based Payment. Employee benefits covered by this section will be one of
the following four types:
(a)
short-term employee benefits, which are employee benefits (other than
termination benefits) that are wholly due within twelve months after
the end of the period in which the employees render the related
service;
(b)
post-employment benefits, which are employee benefits (other than
termination benefits) that are payable after the completion of
employment;
(c)
other long-term employee benefits, which are employee benefits (other
than post-employment benefits and termination benefits) that are not
wholly due within twelve months after the end of the period in which
the employees render the related service; and
(d)
termination benefits, which are employee benefits payable as a result
of either:
(i)
an entity’s decision to terminate an employee’s employment
before the normal retirement date; or
(ii)
an employee’s decision to accept an offer of benefits in
exchange for termination of employment.
Employee benefits also include share-based payment transactions by which
employees receive equity instruments (such as shares or share options) or
cash or other assets of the entity in amounts that are based on the price of the
entity’s shares or other equity instruments of the entity. An entity shall apply
Section 26 in accounting for share-based payment transactions.
General recognition principle for all employee benefits
An entity shall recognise the cost of all employee benefits to which its
employees have become entitled as a result of service rendered to the entity
during the reporting period:
(a)
as a liability, after deducting amounts that have been paid either
directly to the employees or as a contribution to an employee benefit
fund. If the amount paid exceeds the obligation arising from service
before the reporting date, an entity shall recognise that excess as an
asset to the extent that the prepayment will lead to a reduction in
future payments or a cash refund.
28.1
28.2
28.3
IFRS FOR SMES ACCOUNTING STANDARD
© IFRS Foundation
223
 (b)
as an expense, unless another section of this Standard requires the
cost to be recognised as part of the cost of an asset such as inventories
or property, plant and equipment.
Short-term employee benefits
Examples
Short-term employee benefits include items such as:
(a)
wages, salaries and social security contributions;
(b)
short-term compensated absences (such as paid annual leave and paid
sick leave) when the absences are expected to occur within twelve
months after the end of the period in which the employees render the
related employee service;
(c)
profit-sharing and bonuses payable within twelve months after the end
of the period in which the employees render the related service; and
(d)
non-monetary benefits (such as medical care, housing, cars and free or
subsidised goods or services) for current employees.
Measurement of short-term benefits
When an employee has rendered service to an entity during the reporting
period, the entity shall measure the amounts recognised in accordance with
paragraph 28.3 at the undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits
expected to be paid in exchange for that service.
Recognition and measurement—short-term compensated
absences
An entity may compensate employees for absence for various reasons
including annual vacation leave and sick leave. Some short-term compensated
absences accumulate—they can be carried forward and used in future periods
if the employee does not use the current period’s entitlement in full.
Examples include annual vacation leave and sick leave. An entity shall
recognise the expected cost of accumulating compensated absences when the
employees render service that increases their entitlement to future
compensated absences. The entity shall measure the expected cost of
accumulating compensated absences at the undiscounted additional amount
that the entity expects to pay as a result of the unused entitlement that has
accumulated at the end of the reporting period. The entity shall present this
amount as a current liability at the reporting date.
An entity shall recognise the cost of other (non-accumulating) compensated
absences when the absences occur. The entity shall measure the cost of
non-accumulating compensated absences at the undiscounted amount of
salaries and wages paid or payable for the period of absence.
28.4
28.5
28.6
28.7
FEBRUARY 2025
224
© IFRS Foundation
 Recognition—profit-sharing and bonus plans
An entity shall recognise the expected cost of profit-sharing and bonus
payments only when:
(a)
the entity has a present legal or constructive obligation to make such
payments as a result of past events (this means that the entity has no
realistic alternative but to make the payments); and
(b)
a reliable estimate of the obligation can be made.
Post-employment benefits: distinction between defined
contribution plans and defined benefit plans
Post-employment benefits include, for example:
(a)
retirement benefits, such as pensions; and
(b)
other post-employment benefits, such as post-employment life
insurance and post-employment medical care.
Arrangements whereby an entity provides post-employment benefits are
post-employment benefit plans. An entity shall apply this section to all such
arrangements whether or not they involve the establishment of a separate
entity to receive contributions and to pay benefits. In some cases, these
arrangements are imposed by law instead of by action of the entity. In some
cases, these arrangements arise from actions of the entity even in the absence
of a formal, documented plan.
Post-employment benefit plans are classified as either defined contribution
plans or defined benefit plans, depending on their principal terms and
conditions:
(a)
defined contribution plans are post-employment benefit plans under
which an entity pays fixed contributions into a separate entity (a fund)
and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions
or to make direct benefit payments to employees if the fund does not
hold sufficient assets to pay all employee benefits relating to employee
service in the current and prior periods. Thus, the amount of the post-
employment benefits received by the employee is determined by the
amount of contributions paid by an entity (and perhaps also the
employee) to a post-employment benefit plan or to an insurer, together
with investment returns arising from the contributions.
(b)
defined benefit plans are post-employment benefit plans other than
defined contribution plans. Under defined benefit plans, the entity’s
obligation is to provide the agreed benefits to current and former
employees, and actuarial risk (that benefits will cost more or less than
expected) and investment risk (that returns on assets set aside to fund
the benefits will differ from expectations) are borne, in substance, by
the entity. If actuarial or investment experience is worse than
expected, the entity’s obligation may be increased, and vice versa if
actuarial or investment experience is better than expected.

28.9
28.10
IFRS FOR SMES ACCOUNTING STANDARD

225
 Multi-employer plans and state plans
Multi-employer plans and state plans are classified as defined contribution
plans or defined benefit plans on the basis of the terms of the plan, including
any constructive obligation that goes beyond the formal terms. However, if
sufficient information is not available to use defined benefit accounting for a
multi-employer plan or a state plan that is a defined benefit plan, an entity
shall account for the plan in accordance with paragraph 28.13 as if it was a
defined 
contribution 
plan 
and 
make 
the 
disclosures 
required 
by
paragraph 28.40.
Insured benefits
An entity may pay insurance premiums to fund a post-employment benefit
plan. The entity shall treat such a plan as a defined contribution plan unless
the entity has a legal or constructive obligation either:
(a)
to pay the employee benefits directly when they become due; or
(b)
to pay further amounts if the insurer does not pay all future employee
benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.
A constructive obligation could arise indirectly through the plan, through the
mechanism for setting future premiums, or through a related party
relationship with the insurer. If the entity retains such a legal or constructive
obligation, the entity shall treat the plan as a defined benefit plan.
Post-employment benefits: defined contribution plans
Recognition and measurement
An entity shall recognise the contribution payable for a period:
(a)
as a liability, after deducting any amount already paid. If contribution
payments exceed the contribution due for service before the reporting
date, an entity shall recognise that excess as an asset.
(b)
as an expense, unless another section of this Standard requires the cost
to be recognised as part of the cost of an asset such as inventories or
property, plant and equipment.
Post-employment benefits: defined benefit plans
Recognition
In applying the general recognition principle in paragraph 28.3 to defined
benefit plans, an entity shall recognise:
(a)
a liability for its obligations under defined benefit plans net of plan
assets—its ‘defined benefit liability’ (see paragraphs 28.15–28.23); and
(b)
the net change in that liability during the period as the cost of its
defined benefit plans during the period (see paragraphs 28.24–28.27).
28.11
28.12
28.13
28.14
FEBRUARY 2025

 Measurement of the defined benefit liability
An entity shall measure a defined benefit liability for its obligations under
defined benefit plans at the net total of the following amounts:
(a)
the present value of its obligations under defined benefit plans (its
defined benefit obligation) at the reporting date (paragraphs
28.16–28.22 provide guidance for measuring this obligation); minus
(b)
the fair value at the reporting date of plan assets (if any) out of which
the obligations are to be settled directly. Section 12 Fair Value
Measurement provides guidance for determining the fair values of those
plan assets.
Inclusion of both vested and unvested benefits
The present value of an entity’s obligations under defined benefit plans at the
reporting date shall reflect the estimated amount of benefit that employees
have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods,
including benefits that are not yet vested (see paragraph 28.26) and including
the effects of benefit formulas that give employees greater benefits for later
years of service. This requires the entity to determine how much benefit is
attributable to the current and prior periods on the basis of the plan’s benefit
formula and to make estimates (actuarial assumptions) about demographic
variables (such as employee turnover and mortality) and financial variables
(such as future increases in salaries and medical costs) that influence the cost
of the benefit. The actuarial assumptions shall be unbiased (neither
imprudent nor excessively conservative), mutually compatible and selected to
lead to the best estimate of the future cash flows that will arise under the
plan.
Discounting
An entity shall determine the rate used to discount the future payments by
reference to market yields at the reporting date on high quality corporate
bonds. For currencies for which there is no deep market in such high quality
corporate bonds, the entity shall use the market yields (at the reporting date)
on government bonds denominated in that currency. The currency and term
of the corporate bonds or government bonds shall be consistent with the
currency and estimated period of the future payments.
Actuarial valuation method
If an entity is able, without undue cost or effort, to use the projected unit
credit method to measure its defined benefit obligation and the related
expense, it shall do so. If defined benefits are based on future salaries, the
projected unit credit method requires an entity to measure its defined benefit
obligations on a basis that reflects estimated future salary increases.
Additionally, the projected unit credit method requires an entity to make
various actuarial assumptions in measuring the defined benefit obligation,
including discount rates, the expected rates of return on plan assets, expected
28.15
28.16
28.17
28.18
IFRS FOR SMES ACCOUNTING STANDARD
© IFRS Foundation
227
 rates of salary increases, employee turnover, mortality, and (for defined
benefit medical plans) medical cost trend rates.
If using the projected unit credit method to measure an entity’s obligation
under defined benefit plans would involve undue cost or effort, the entity is
permitted to measure the obligation with respect to current employees by
both:
(a)
assuming all the entity’s employees terminate their employment at the
reporting date and ignoring:
(i)
estimated future salary increases.
(ii)
future service.
(iii)
possible in-service mortality of current employees between the
reporting date and the date employees are expected to begin
receiving post-employment benefits (that is, assume all current
employees will receive the post-employment benefits). Mortality
after service (that is, life expectancy) shall be considered.
(b)
not discounting that obligation.
An entity that uses the foregoing measurement simplification must still
include both vested benefits and unvested benefits when measuring its
obligation under defined benefit plans.
This Standard does not require an entity to engage an independent actuary to
perform the comprehensive actuarial valuation needed to calculate its defined
benefit obligation. Nor does it require that a comprehensive actuarial
valuation must be done annually. In the periods between comprehensive
actuarial valuations, if the principal actuarial assumptions have not changed
significantly the defined benefit obligation can be measured by adjusting the
prior period measurement for changes in employee demographics such as
number of employees and salary levels.
Plan introductions, changes, curtailments and
settlements
If a defined benefit plan has been introduced or changed in the current
period, the entity shall increase or decrease its defined benefit liability to
reflect the change, and shall recognise the increase (decrease) as an expense
(income) in measuring profit or loss in the current period. Conversely, if a
plan has been curtailed (ie benefits or group of covered employees are
reduced) or settled (the employer’s obligation is completely discharged) in the
current period, the defined benefit obligation shall be decreased or eliminated
and the entity shall recognise the resulting gain or loss in profit or loss in the
current period.
28.19
28.20
28.21
FEBRUARY 2025
228
© IFRS Foundation
 Defined benefit plan asset
If the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the reporting date is
less than the fair value of plan assets at that date, the plan has a surplus. An
entity shall recognise a plan surplus as a defined benefit plan asset only to the
extent that it is able to recover the surplus either through reduced
contributions in the future or through refunds from the plan.
Cost of a defined benefit plan
An entity shall recognise the net change in its defined benefit liability during
the period, other than a change attributable to benefits paid to employees
during the period or to contributions from the employer, as the cost of its
defined benefit plans during the period. That cost is recognised either entirely
in profit or loss as an expense or partly in profit or loss and partly as an item
of other comprehensive income (see paragraph 28.24) unless another section
of this Standard requires the cost to be recognised as part of the cost of an
asset such as inventories or property, plant and equipment.
Recognition–accounting policy election
An entity is required to recognise all actuarial gains and losses in the period in
which they occur. An entity shall:
(a)
recognise all actuarial gains and losses in profit or loss; or
(b)
recognise all actuarial gains and losses in other comprehensive income.
as an accounting policy election. The entity shall apply its chosen accounting
policy consistently to all of its defined benefit plans and all of its actuarial
gains and losses. Actuarial gains and losses recognised in other comprehensive
income shall be presented in the statement of comprehensive income.
The net change in the defined benefit liability that is recognised as the cost of
a defined benefit plan includes:
(a)
the change in the defined benefit liability arising from employee
service rendered during the reporting period;
(b)
interest on the defined benefit obligation during the reporting period;
(c)
the returns on any plan assets and the net change in the fair value of
recognised reimbursement rights (see paragraph 28.28) during the
reporting period;
(d)
actuarial gains and losses arising in the reporting period;
(e)
increases or decreases in the defined benefit liability resulting from
introducing a new plan or changing an existing plan in the reporting
period (see paragraph 28.21); and
(f)
decreases in the defined benefit liability resulting from curtailing or
settling an existing plan in the reporting period (see paragraph 28.21).

IFRS FOR SMES ACCOUNTING STANDARD

229
 Employee service gives rise to an obligation under a defined benefit plan even
if the benefits are conditional on future employment (in other words, they are
not yet vested). In measuring its defined benefit obligation, an entity considers
the probability that some employees may not satisfy vesting requirements.
Similarly, although some post-employment benefits (such as post-employment
medical benefits) become payable only if a specified event occurs when an
employee is no longer employed (such as an illness), an obligation is created
when the employee renders service that will provide entitlement to the
benefit if the specified event occurs. The probability that the specified event
will occur affects the measurement of the obligation, but does not determine
whether the obligation exists.
If defined benefits are reduced for amounts that will be paid to employees
under government-sponsored plans, an entity shall measure its defined benefit
obligations on a basis that reflects the benefits payable under the government
plans, but only if:
(a)
those plans were enacted before the reporting date; or
(b)
past history, or other reliable evidence, indicates that those state
benefits will change in some predictable manner, for example, in line
with future changes in general price levels or general salary levels.
Reimbursements
If an entity is virtually certain that another party will reimburse some or all of
the expenditure required to settle a defined benefit obligation, the entity shall
recognise its right to reimbursement as a separate asset. The entity shall
measure the asset at fair value. In the statement of comprehensive income (or
in the income statement, if presented), the expense relating to a defined
benefit plan may be presented net of the amount recognised for a
reimbursement.
Other long-term employee benefits
Other long-term employee benefits include, for example:
(a)
long-term compensated absences such as long-service or sabbatical
leave;
(b)
long-service benefits;
(c)
long-term disability benefits;
(d)
profit-sharing and bonuses payable twelve months or more after the
end of the period in which the employees render the related service;
and
(e)
deferred compensation paid twelve months or more after the end of
the period in which it is earned.
28.26
28.27
28.28
28.29
FEBRUARY 2025
230
© IFRS Foundation
 An entity shall recognise a liability for other long-term employee benefits
measured at the net total of the following amounts:
(a)
the present value of the benefit obligation at the reporting date; minus
(b)
the fair value at the reporting date of plan assets (if any) out of which
the obligations are to be settled directly.
An entity shall recognise the net change in the liability during the period,
other than a change attributable to benefits paid to employees during the
period or to contributions from the employer, as the cost of its other
long-term employee benefits during the period. That cost is recognised
entirely in profit or loss as an expense unless another section of this Standard
requires it to be recognised as part of the cost of an asset, such as inventories
or property, plant and equipment.
Termination benefits
Termination benefits result from either an entity’s decision to terminate
employment or an employee’s decision to accept an entity’s offer of benefits
in exchange for termination of employment. The form of the employee
benefit does not determine whether it is provided in exchange for service or in
exchange for termination of the employee’s employment. Some termination
benefits are provided in accordance with the terms of an employee benefit
plan. For example, the benefits might be specified by statute, employment
contract or union agreement, or might be implied as a result of the
employer’s past practice of providing similar benefits. Employee benefits
provided in accordance with the terms of an employee benefit plan are
termination benefits if they both result from an entity’s decision to terminate
employment and are not conditional on future service being provided.
Recognition
Because termination benefits do not provide an entity with future economic
benefits, an entity shall recognise them as an expense in profit or loss
immediately.
When an entity recognises termination benefits, the entity may also have to
account for a curtailment of retirement benefits or other employee benefits.
An entity shall recognise a liability and an expense for termination benefits at
the earlier of:
(a)
the date at which the entity can no longer withdraw the offer of those
benefits; and
(b)
the date at which the entity recognises costs for a restructuring that is
within the scope of Section 21 Provisions and Contingencies and involves
the payment of termination benefits.
28.30

IFRS FOR SMES ACCOUNTING STANDARD
© IFRS Foundation
231
 For termination benefits payable as a result of an employee’s decision to
accept an offer of benefits in exchange for termination of employment, the
time when an entity can no longer withdraw the offer of termination benefits
is the earlier of:
(a)
the date at which the employee accepts the offer; and
(b)
the date at which a restriction (for example, a legal, regulatory or
contractual restriction) on the entity’s ability to withdraw the offer
takes effect—which would be the date the offer is made, if the
restriction existed at the time of the offer.
For termination benefits payable as a result of an entity’s decision to
terminate employment, the entity can no longer withdraw the offer after it
has communicated to the affected employees a termination plan for which all
of these criteria apply:
(a)
actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that
significant changes to the plan will be made;
(b)
the plan identifies the number of employees whose employment is to
be terminated, their job classifications or functions and their locations
(but the plan need not identify each individual employee) and the
expected completion date; and
(c)
the plan establishes the termination benefits that employees will
receive in sufficient detail that employees can determine the type and
amount of benefits they will receive when their employment is
terminated.
[Deleted]
Measurement
An entity shall measure termination benefits at the best estimate of the
expenditure that would be required to settle the obligation at the reporting
date. In the case of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy, the
measurement of termination benefits shall be based on the number of
employees expected to accept the offer.
When termination benefits are due more than twelve months after the end of
the reporting period, they shall be measured at their present value.
Group plans
If a parent entity provides benefits to the employees of one or more
subsidiaries in the group, and the parent presents consolidated financial
statements using either the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard or full IFRS
Accounting Standards, such subsidiaries are permitted to recognise and
measure employee benefit expense on the basis of a reasonable allocation of
the expense recognised for the group.

 Disclosures
Disclosures about short-term employee benefits
This section does not require specific disclosures about short-term employee
benefits.
Disclosures about defined contribution plans
An entity shall disclose the amount recognised in profit or loss as an expense
for defined contribution plans. If an entity treats a defined benefit
multi-employer or state plan as a defined contribution plan because sufficient
information 
for 
defined 
benefit 
accounting 
is 
not 
available 
(see
paragraph 28.11) it shall disclose the fact that the plan is a defined benefit

 Section 29
Income Tax
Scope of this section
For the purpose of this Standard, income tax includes all domestic and foreign
taxes that are based on taxable profit. Income tax also includes taxes, such as
withholding taxes, that are payable by a subsidiary, associate or joint
arrangement on distributions to the reporting entity.
This section covers accounting for income tax. It requires an entity to
recognise the current and future tax consequences of transactions and other
events that have been recognised in the financial statements. These
recognised tax amounts comprise current tax and deferred tax. Current tax is
income tax payable (recoverable) in respect of the taxable profit (tax loss) for
the current period or past periods. Deferred tax is income tax payable or
recoverable in future periods, generally as a result of the entity recovering or
settling its assets and liabilities for their current carrying amount, and the
tax effect of the carryforward of currently unused tax losses and tax credits.
This section does not deal with the methods of accounting for government
grants (see Section 24 Government Grants). However, this section does deal with
the accounting for temporary differences that may arise from such grants.
This section applies to income taxes arising from tax law enacted or
substantively enacted to implement the Pillar Two model rules published by
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD),
including tax law that implements qualified domestic minimum top-up taxes
described in those rules. Such tax law, and the income taxes arising from it,
are hereafter referred to as ‘Pillar Two legislation’ and ‘Pillar Two income
taxes’. As an exception to the requirements in this section, an entity shall
neither recognise deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two
income taxes nor disclose information that would otherwise be required by
paragraphs 29.39–29.40 about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to
Pillar Two income taxes.
Recognition and measurement of current tax
An entity shall recognise a current tax liability for tax payable on taxable
profit for the current and past periods. If the amount paid for the current and
past periods exceeds the amount payable for those periods, the entity shall
recognise the excess as a current tax asset.
An entity shall recognise a current tax asset for the benefit of a tax loss that
can be carried back to recover tax paid in a previous period.
An entity shall measure a current tax liability (asset) at the amount it expects
to pay (recover) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the reporting date. An entity shall regard tax rates
and tax laws as substantively enacted when the remaining steps in the

 enactment process have not affected the outcome in the past and are unlikely
to do so. Paragraphs 29.32–29.33 provide additional measurement guidance.
Recognition of deferred tax
General recognition principle
It is inherent in the recognition of an asset or a liability that the reporting
entity expects to recover or settle the carrying amount of that asset or
liability. If it is probable that recovery or settlement of that carrying amount
will make future tax payments larger (smaller) than they would be if such
recovery or settlement were to have no tax consequences, this section requires
an entity to recognise a deferred tax liability (deferred tax asset) with certain
limited exceptions. If the entity expects to recover the carrying amount of an
asset or settle the carrying amount of a liability without affecting taxable
profit, no deferred tax arises in respect of the asset or liability.
An entity shall recognise a deferred tax asset or liability for tax recoverable or
payable in future periods as a result of past transactions or events. Such tax
arises from the differences between the carrying amounts of the entity’s
assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position and the amounts
attributed to those assets and liabilities by the tax authorities (such
differences are called ‘temporary differences’), and the carryforward of
currently unused tax losses and tax credits.
Tax bases and temporary differences
The tax base of an asset is the amount that will be deductible for tax purposes
against any taxable economic benefits that will flow to an entity when it
recovers the carrying amount of the asset. If those economic benefits will not
be taxable, the tax base of the asset is equal to its carrying amount.
The tax base of a liability is its carrying amount less any amount that will be
deductible for tax purposes in respect of that liability in future periods. In the
case of revenue that is received in advance, the tax base of the resulting
liability is its carrying amount less any amount of the revenue that will not be
taxable in future periods.
Some items have a tax base but are not recognised as assets and liabilities in
the statement of financial position. For example, research and development
costs are recognised as an expense when determining accounting profit in
the period in which they are incurred but may not be permitted as a
deduction when determining taxable profit (tax loss) until a later period. The
difference between the tax base of the research and development costs, being
the amount that the taxation authorities will permit as a deduction in future
periods, and the carrying amount of nil is a deductible temporary difference
that results in a deferred tax asset.

 Temporary differences are differences between the carrying amount of an
asset or liability in the statement of financial position and its tax base. In
consolidated financial statements, temporary differences are determined by
comparing the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated
financial statements with the appropriate tax base. The tax base is determined
by reference to a consolidated tax return in those jurisdictions in which such a
return is filed. In other jurisdictions, the tax base is determined by reference
to the tax returns of each entity in the group.
Examples of situations in which temporary differences arise include:
(a)
the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business
combination are recognised at their fair values in accordance with
Section 19 Business Combinations and Goodwill, but no equivalent
adjustment is made for tax purposes (for example, the tax base of an
asset may remain at cost to the previous owner). The resulting deferred
tax asset or liability affects the amount of goodwill that an entity
recognises.
(b)
assets are remeasured but no equivalent adjustment is made for tax
purposes. For example, this Standard permits or requires certain assets
to be remeasured at fair value or to be revalued (for example,
Section 16 Investment Property and Section 17 Property, Plant and
Equipment).
(c)
goodwill arises in a business combination, for example, the tax base of
goodwill will be nil if taxation authorities do not allow the
amortisation or the impairment of goodwill as a deductible expense
when taxable profit is determined and do not permit the cost of
goodwill to be treated as a deductible expense on disposal of the
subsidiary.
(d)
the tax base of an asset or a liability on initial recognition differs from
its initial carrying amount.
(e)
the carrying amount of investments in subsidiaries, branches and
associates or interests in joint arrangements becomes different from
the tax base of the investment or interest.
Not all of these temporary differences will give rise to deferred tax assets and
liabilities (see paragraphs 29.14 and 29.16).
Taxable temporary differences
A deferred tax liability shall be recognised for all taxable temporary
differences, except to the extent that the deferred tax liability arises from:
(a)
the initial recognition of goodwill; or
(b)
the initial recognition of an asset or a liability in a transaction that:
(i)
is not a business combination; and
(ii)
at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit
nor taxable profit (tax loss).
29.12

 However, for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in
subsidiaries, branches and associates, and interests in joint arrangements, a
deferred tax liability shall be recognised in accordance with paragraph 29.25.
Some temporary differences arise when income or expense is included in
accounting profit in one period but is included in taxable profit in a different
period. Such temporary differences are often described as timing differences.
The following are examples of temporary differences of this kind that are
taxable temporary differences and that therefore result in deferred tax
liabilities:
(a)
interest revenue is included in accounting profit on a time-proportion
basis but may, in some jurisdictions, be included in taxable profit
when cash is collected. The tax base of any receivable with respect to
such revenues is nil, because the revenues do not affect taxable profit
until cash is collected.
(b)
depreciation used when determining taxable profit (tax loss) may
differ from that used when determining accounting profit. The
temporary difference is the difference between the carrying amount of
the asset and its tax base, which is the original cost of the asset less all
deductions in respect of that asset permitted by the taxation
authorities when determining taxable profit of the current and prior
periods. A taxable temporary difference arises, and results in a
deferred tax liability, when tax depreciation is accelerated. If the tax
depreciation is less rapid than the accounting depreciation, a
deductible temporary difference arises resulting in a deferred tax asset
(see paragraph 29.16).
Deductible temporary differences
A deferred tax asset shall be recognised for all deductible temporary
differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available
against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilised, unless the
deferred tax asset arises from the initial recognition of an asset or a liability in
a transaction that:
(a)
is not a business combination; and
(b)
at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor
taxable profit (tax loss).
However, for deductible temporary differences associated with investments in
subsidiaries, branches and associates and for interests in joint arrangements, a
deferred tax asset shall be recognised in accordance with paragraph 29.26.
In applying paragraph 29.16, an entity considers whether tax law restricts the
sources of taxable profits against which the deductible temporary difference
can be utilised.

 The following are examples of deductible temporary differences that result in
deferred tax assets:
(a)
retirement benefit costs may be deducted when determining
accounting profit at the time that the service is provided by the
employee, but deducted when determining taxable profit either when
contributions are paid to a fund by the entity or when retirement
benefits are paid by the entity. A temporary difference exists between
the carrying amount of the liability and its tax base; the tax base of the
liability is usually nil. Such a deductible temporary difference results
in a deferred tax asset because economic benefits will flow to the
entity in the form of a deduction from taxable profits when
contributions or retirement benefits are paid.
(b)
certain assets may be carried at fair value, without an equivalent
adjustment being made for tax purposes. A deductible temporary
difference arises if the tax base of the asset exceeds its carrying
amount.
The reversal of deductible temporary differences results in deductions when
taxable profits of future periods are determined. It is probable that taxable
profit will be available against which a deductible temporary difference can be
utilised when there are sufficient taxable temporary differences relating to
the same taxation authority and the same taxable entity that are expected to
reverse:
(a)
in the same period as the expected reversal of the deductible
temporary difference; or
(b)
in periods into which a tax loss arising from the deferred tax asset can
be carried back or forward.
In such circumstances, the deferred tax asset is recognised in the period in
which the deductible temporary differences arise.
When there are insufficient taxable temporary differences relating to the
same taxation authority and the same taxable entity, the deferred tax asset is
recognised to the extent that:
(a)
it is probable that the entity will have sufficient taxable profit relating
to the same taxation authority and the same taxable entity in the same
period as the reversal of the deductible temporary difference (or in the
periods into which a tax loss arising from the deferred tax asset can be
carried back or forward). When evaluating whether it will have
sufficient taxable profit in future periods, an entity:
(i)
compares the deductible temporary differences with future
taxable profit that excludes the tax deductions resulting from
the reversal of those deductible temporary differences. This
comparison shows the extent to which the future taxable profit
is sufficient for the entity to deduct the amounts resulting from
the reversal of those deductible temporary differences.
29.17
29.18
29.19
FEBRUARY 2025
240
© IFRS Foundation
 (ii)
ignores taxable amounts arising from deductible temporary
differences that are expected to originate in future periods,
because the deferred tax asset arising from those deductible
temporary differences will itself require future taxable profit in
order to be utilised.
(b)
tax planning opportunities are available to the entity that will create
taxable profit in appropriate periods.
The estimate of probable future taxable profit might include the recovery of
some of an entity’s assets for more than their carrying amount if there is
sufficient evidence that it is probable that the entity will achieve this.
When an entity has a history of recent losses, the entity considers the
guidance in paragraphs 29.21–29.22.
Unused tax losses and unused tax credits
A deferred tax asset shall be recognised for the carryforward of unused tax
losses and unused tax credits to the extent that it is probable that future
taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax losses and
unused tax credits can be utilised. When assessing the probability that taxable
profit will be available against which the unused tax losses or unused tax
credits can be utilised, an entity considers the following criteria:
(a)
whether the entity has sufficient taxable temporary differences
relating to the same taxation authority and the same taxable entity,
which will result in taxable amounts against which the unused tax
losses or unused tax credits can be utilised before they expire;
(b)
whether it is probable that the entity will have taxable profits before
the unused tax losses or unused tax credits expire;
(c)
whether the unused tax losses result from identifiable causes which
are unlikely to recur; and
(d)
whether tax planning opportunities are available to the entity that will
create taxable profit in the period in which the unused tax losses or
unused tax credits can be utilised.
To the extent that it is not probable that taxable profit will be available
against which the unused tax losses or unused tax credits can be utilised, the
deferred tax asset is not recognised.
The existence of unused tax losses is strong evidence that future taxable profit
may not be available. Consequently, when an entity has a history of recent
losses, the entity recognises a deferred tax asset arising from unused tax losses
or tax credits only to the extent that the entity has sufficient taxable
temporary differences or to the extent that there is convincing other evidence
that sufficient taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax
losses or unused tax credits can be utilised by the entity.

 Reassessment of unrecognised deferred tax assets
At the end of each reporting period, an entity reassesses any unrecognised
deferred tax assets. The entity recognises a previously unrecognised deferred
tax asset to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit
will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Investments in subsidiaries, branches and associates and
interests in joint arrangements
Temporary differences arise when the carrying amount of investments in
subsidiaries, branches and associates and interests in joint arrangements (for
example, in the parent’s consolidated financial statements the carrying
amount of a subsidiary is the net consolidated assets of that subsidiary,
including the carrying amount of any related goodwill) becomes different
from the tax base (which is often cost) of the investment or interest. Such
differences may arise in a number of different circumstances, for example:
(a)
the existence of undistributed profits of subsidiaries, branches,
associates and joint arrangements;
(b)
changes in foreign exchange rates when a parent and its subsidiary are
based in different countries; and
(c)
a reduction in the carrying amount of an investment in an associate to
its recoverable amount.
Investments may be accounted for differently in the parent's separate
financial statements compared to the consolidated financial statements, in
which case the temporary difference associated with that investment may also
differ. For example, in the parent’s separate financial statements the carrying
amount of a subsidiary will depend on the accounting policy chosen in
paragraph 9.26.
An entity shall recognise a deferred tax liability for all taxable temporary
differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches and
associates, and interests in joint arrangements, except to the extent that both
of the following conditions are satisfied:
(a)
the parent, investor or party to the joint arrangement is able to control
the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference; and
(b)
it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the
foreseeable future.
An entity shall recognise a deferred tax asset for all deductible temporary
differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, branches and associates
and interests in joint arrangements, only to the extent that it is probable that:
(a)
the temporary difference will reverse in the foreseeable future; and
(b)
taxable profit will be available against which the temporary difference
can be utilised.

 Measurement of deferred tax
An entity shall measure a deferred tax liability (asset) using the tax rates and
tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting
date. An entity shall regard tax rates and tax laws as substantively enacted
when the remaining steps in the enactment process have not affected the
outcome in the past and are unlikely to do so.
When different tax rates apply to different levels of taxable profit, an entity
shall measure deferred tax liabilities (assets) using the average enacted or
substantively enacted rates that it expects to be applicable to the taxable profit
(tax loss) of the periods in which it expects the deferred tax liability to be
settled (deferred tax asset to be realised).
The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets shall
reflect the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the
entity expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount
of the related assets and liabilities. Consequently, an entity measures deferred
tax liabilities and deferred tax assets using the tax rate and the tax base that
are consistent with the expected manner of recovery or settlement. For
example, if the temporary difference arises from an item of income that is
expected to be taxable as a capital gain in a future period, the deferred tax
expense is measured using the capital gain tax rate and the tax base that is
consistent with recovering the carrying amount through sale.
If a deferred tax liability or deferred tax asset arises from a non-depreciable
asset measured using the revaluation model in Section 17, the measurement
of the deferred tax liability or deferred tax asset shall reflect the tax
consequences of recovering the carrying amount of the non-depreciable asset
through sale. If a deferred tax liability or asset arises from investment
property that is measured at fair value, there is a rebuttable presumption that
the carrying amount of the investment property will be recovered through
sale. Accordingly, unless the presumption is rebutted, the measurement of the
deferred tax liability or the deferred tax asset shall reflect the tax
consequences of recovering the carrying amount of the investment property
entirely through sale. This presumption is rebutted if the investment property
is depreciable and is held within a business model whose objective is to
consume substantially all of the economic benefits embodied in the
investment property over time, instead of through sale. If the presumption is
rebutted, the requirements of paragraph 29.29 shall be followed.
The carrying amount of a deferred tax asset shall be reviewed at the end of
each reporting period. An entity shall reduce the carrying amount of a
deferred tax asset to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient
taxable profit will be available to allow the benefit of part or all of that
recognised deferred tax asset to be utilised. Any such reduction shall be
reversed to the extent that it becomes probable that sufficient taxable profit
will be available.

 Measurement of both current and deferred tax
An entity shall not discount current or deferred tax assets and liabilities.
In some jurisdictions, income tax is payable at a higher or lower rate if part or
all of the profit or retained earnings is paid out as a dividend to shareholders
of the entity. In other jurisdictions, income tax may be refundable or payable
if part or all of the profit or retained earnings is paid out as a dividend to
shareholders of the entity. In both of those circumstances, an entity shall
measure current and deferred tax at the tax rate applicable to undistributed
profits until the entity recognises a liability to pay a dividend. When the
entity recognises a liability to pay a dividend, it shall recognise the resulting
current or deferred tax liability (asset) and the related tax expense (income).
Withholding tax on dividends
When an entity pays dividends to its shareholders, it may be required to pay a
portion of the dividends to taxation authorities on behalf of shareholders.
Such an amount paid or payable to taxation authorities is charged to equity as
a part of the dividends.
Uncertainty over income tax treatments
It might not be clear how tax law applies to a particular transaction or
circumstance. An uncertain tax treatment is a tax treatment whose
acceptability by the relevant taxation authority under tax law is uncertain.
An entity shall determine whether to consider each uncertain tax treatment
separately or together with one or more other uncertain tax treatments based
on which approach better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty.
An entity shall assume that a taxation authority will examine amounts it has
a right to examine and have full knowledge of all related information when
making those examinations. If an entity concludes that it is:
(a)
probable that the taxation authority will accept an uncertain tax
treatment, the entity shall determine the taxable profit (tax loss), tax
bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits or tax rates consistently
with the tax treatment used or planned to be used in its income tax
filings; or
(b)
not probable that the taxation authority will accept an uncertain tax
treatment, the entity shall reflect the effect of uncertainty in
determining the related taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases, unused tax
losses, unused tax credits or tax rates by using either of the following
methods, depending on which better predicts the resolution of the
uncertainty:
(i)
the most likely amount—the single most likely amount in a
range of possible outcomes; or
(ii)
the expected value—the sum of the probability-weighted
amounts in a range of possible outcomes.

Presentation
Allocation in comprehensive income and equity
An entity shall recognise tax expense in the same component of total
comprehensive income (ie continuing operations, discontinued operations
or other comprehensive income) or equity as the transaction or other event
that resulted in the tax expense.
Current/non-current distinction
When an entity presents current and non-current assets, and current and
non-current liabilities, as separate classifications in its statement of financial
position, it shall not classify any deferred tax assets (liabilities) as current
assets (liabilities).
Offsetting
An entity shall offset current tax assets and current tax liabilities, if, and only
if, it has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and the entity
intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the
liability simultaneously.
An entity shall offset deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities if, and
only if:
(a)
it has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against
current tax liabilities; and
(b)
the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to income
taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either:
(i)
the same taxable entity; or
(ii)
different taxable entities that intend either to settle current tax
liabilities and assets on a net basis, or to realise the assets and
settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in
which significant amounts of deferred tax liabilities or assets
are expected to be settled or recovered.
Disclosures
An entity shall disclose information that enables users of its financial
statements to evaluate the nature and financial effect of the current and
deferred tax consequences of recognised transactions and other events
(including the enactment or substantive enactment of tax rates and tax laws,
such as Pillar Two legislation).

 Section 30
Foreign Currency Translation
Scope of this section
An entity can conduct foreign activities in two ways. It may have transactions
in foreign currencies or it may have foreign operations. In addition, an entity
may present its financial statements in a foreign currency. This section
prescribes how to include foreign currency transactions and foreign
operations in the financial statements of an entity and how to translate
financial statements into a presentation currency. Accounting for financial
instruments that derive their value from the change in a specified foreign
exchange rate (for example, foreign currency forward exchange contracts) and
hedge accounting of foreign currency items are dealt with in Part II of Section
11 Financial Instruments.
Functional currency
Each entity shall identify its functional currency. An entity’s functional
currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the
entity operates.
The primary economic environment in which an entity operates is normally
the one in which it primarily generates and expends cash. Consequently, the
following are the most important factors an entity considers in determining
its functional currency:
(a)
the currency:
(i)
that mainly influences sales prices for goods and services (this
will often be the currency in which sales prices for its goods
and services are denominated and settled); and
(ii)
of the country whose competitive forces and regulations mainly
determine the sales prices of its goods and services.
(b)
the currency that mainly influences labour, material and other costs of
providing goods or services (this will often be the currency in which
such costs are denominated and settled).
The following factors may also provide evidence of an entity’s functional
currency:
(a)
the currency in which funds from financing activities (issuing debt and
equity instruments) are generated; and
(b)
the currency in which receipts from operating activities are usually
retained.

 The following additional factors are considered in determining the functional
currency of a foreign operation, and whether its functional currency is the
same as that of the reporting entity (the reporting entity, in this context,
being the entity that has the foreign operation as its subsidiary, branch,
associate or joint arrangement):
(a)
whether the activities of the foreign operation are carried out as an
extension of the reporting entity, instead of being carried out with a
significant degree of autonomy. An example of the former is when the
foreign operation only sells goods imported from the reporting entity
and remits the proceeds to it. An example of the latter is when the
operation accumulates cash and other monetary items, incurs
expenses, generates income and arranges borrowings, all substantially
in its local currency.
(b)
whether transactions with the reporting entity are a high or a low
proportion of the foreign operation’s activities.
(c)
whether cash flows from the activities of the foreign operation directly
affect the cash flows of the reporting entity and are readily available
for remittance to it.
(d)
whether cash flows from the activities of the foreign operation are
sufficient to service existing and normally expected debt obligations
without funds being made available by the reporting entity.
Estimating the spot exchange rate when a currency is not
exchangeable (paragraphs 30A.12–30A.18)
If, at a measurement date, a currency is not exchangeable into another
currency (as described in paragraphs 30A.2–30A.11), an entity shall estimate
the spot exchange rate at that date. An entity’s objective in estimating the
spot exchange rate is to reflect the rate at which an orderly exchange
transaction would take place at the measurement date between market
participants under prevailing economic conditions.
Reporting foreign currency transactions in the functional
currency
Initial recognition
A foreign currency transaction is a transaction that is denominated or
requires settlement in a foreign currency, including transactions arising when
an entity:
(a)
buys or sells goods or services whose price is denominated in a foreign
currency;
(b)
borrows or lends funds when the amounts payable or receivable are
denominated in a foreign currency; or
(c)
otherwise acquires or disposes of assets, or incurs or settles liabilities,
denominated in a foreign currency.
30.5
30.5A
30.6
IFRS FOR SMES ACCOUNTING STANDARD
© IFRS Foundation
249
 An entity shall record a foreign currency transaction, on initial recognition in
the functional currency, by applying to the foreign currency amount the spot
exchange rate between the functional currency and the foreign currency at
the date of the transaction.
The date of a transaction is the date on which the transaction first qualifies
for recognition in accordance with this Standard. For practical reasons, a rate
that approximates the actual rate at the date of the transaction is often used,
for example, an average rate for a week or a month might be used for all
transactions in each foreign currency occurring during that period. However,
if exchange rates fluctuate significantly, the use of the average rate for a
period is inappropriate.
When an entity pays or receives consideration in advance in a foreign
currency, it recognises a non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability. The
exchange rate to be used on the initial recognition of the related asset,
expense or income (or part of it) is the exchange rate at the date on which the
entity initially recognised the non-monetary asset or the non-monetary
liability arising from the payment or receipt of advance consideration. If there
are multiple payments or receipts in advance, the entity shall determine a
date of the transaction for each payment or receipt of advance consideration.
Reporting at the end of the subsequent reporting periods
At the end of each reporting period, an entity shall:
(a)
translate foreign currency monetary items using the closing rate;
(b)
translate non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical
cost in a foreign currency using the exchange rate at the date of the
transaction; and
(c)
translate non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a
foreign currency using the exchange rates at the date when the fair
value was determined.
An entity shall recognise, in profit or loss in the period in which they arise,
exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on
translating monetary items at rates different from those at which they were
translated on initial recognition during the period or in previous periods,
except as described in paragraph 30.13.
When another section of this Standard requires a gain or loss on a
non-monetary item to be recognised in other comprehensive income, an
entity shall recognise any exchange component of that gain or loss in other
comprehensive income. Conversely, when a gain or loss on a non-monetary
item is recognised in profit or loss, an entity shall recognise any exchange
component of that gain or loss in profit or loss.

 Net investment in a foreign operation
An entity may have a monetary item that is receivable from or payable to a
foreign operation. An item for which settlement is neither planned nor likely
to occur in the foreseeable future is, in substance, a part of the entity’s net
investment in that foreign operation, and is accounted for in accordance with
paragraph 30.13. Such monetary items may include long-term receivables or
loans. They do not include trade receivables or trade payables.
Exchange differences arising on a monetary item that forms part of a
reporting entity’s net investment in a foreign operation shall be recognised in
profit or loss in the separate financial statements of the reporting entity or
the individual financial statements of the foreign operation, as appropriate. In
the financial statements that include the foreign operation and the reporting
entity (for example, consolidated financial statements when the foreign
operation is a subsidiary), such exchange differences shall be recognised in
other comprehensive income and reported as a component of equity. They
shall not be recognised in profit or loss on disposal of the net investment.
Change in functional currency
When there is a change in an entity’s functional currency, the entity shall
apply the translation procedures applicable to the new functional currency
prospectively from the date of the change.
As noted in paragraphs 30.2–30.5, the functional currency of an entity reflects
the underlying transactions, events and conditions that are relevant to the
entity. Accordingly, once the functional currency is determined, it can be
changed only if there is a change to those underlying transactions, events and
conditions. For example, a change in the currency that mainly influences the
sales prices of goods and services may lead to a change in an entity’s
functional currency.
The effect of a change in functional currency is accounted for prospectively. In
other words, an entity translates all items into the new functional currency
using the exchange rate at the date of the change. The resulting translated
amounts for non-monetary items are treated as their historical cost.
Use of a presentation currency other than the functional currency
Translation to the presentation currency
An entity may present its financial statements in any currency (or currencies).
If the presentation currency differs from the entity’s functional currency, the
entity shall translate its items of income and expense and financial position
into the presentation currency. For example, when a group contains
individual entities with different functional currencies, the items of income
and expense and financial position of each entity are expressed in a common
currency so that consolidated financial statements may be presented.

 An 
entity 
whose 
functional 
currency 
is 
not 
the 
currency 
of 
a
hyperinflationary economy shall translate its results and financial position
into a different presentation currency using the following procedures:
(a)
assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position
presented (ie including comparatives) shall be translated at the closing
rate at the date of that statement of financial position;
(b)
income and expenses for each statement of comprehensive income (ie
including comparatives) shall be translated at exchange rates at the
dates of the transactions; and
(c)
all resulting exchange differences shall be recognised in other
comprehensive income and reported as a component of equity. They
shall not subsequently be reclassified to profit or loss.
For practical reasons, an entity may use a rate that approximates the exchange
rates at the dates of the transactions, for example an average rate for the
period, to translate income and expense items. However, if exchange rates
fluctuate significantly, the use of the average rate for a period is
inappropriate.
The exchange differences referred to in paragraph 30.18(c) result from:
(a)
translating income and expenses at the exchange rates at the dates of
the transactions and assets and liabilities at the closing rate; and
(b)
translating the opening net assets at a closing rate that differs from the
previous closing rate.
When the exchange differences relate to a foreign operation that is
consolidated but not wholly-owned, accumulated exchange differences arising
from translation and attributable to the non-controlling interest are
allocated to, and recognised as part of, non-controlling interest in the
consolidated statement of financial position.
An entity whose functional currency is the currency of a hyperinflationary
economy shall translate its results and financial position into a different
presentation currency using the procedures specified in Section 31
Hyperinflation.
Translation of a foreign operation into the investor’s
presentation currency
In incorporating the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a foreign
operation with those of the reporting entity, the entity shall follow normal
consolidation procedures, such as the elimination of intragroup balances and
intragroup transactions of a subsidiary (see Section 9 Consolidated and Separate
Financial Statements) and the translation procedures set out in paragraphs
30.17–30.21. However, an intragroup monetary asset (or liability), whether
short-term or long-term, cannot be eliminated against the corresponding
intragroup liability (or asset) without showing the results of currency
fluctuations in the consolidated financial statements. This is because the
monetary item represents a commitment to convert one currency into
30.18
30.19
30.20
30.21

 another and exposes the reporting entity to a gain or loss through currency
fluctuations. Accordingly, in the consolidated financial statements, a
reporting entity continues to recognise such an exchange difference in profit
or loss or, if it arises from the circumstances described in paragraph 30.13, the
entity shall recognise it as other comprehensive income.
Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair
value adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities arising on
the acquisition of that foreign operation shall be treated as assets and
liabilities of the foreign operation. Thus, they shall be expressed in the
functional currency of the foreign operation and shall be translated at the
closing rate in accordance with paragraph 30.18.
Disclosures
In paragraphs 30.26 and 30.27, references to ‘functional currency’ apply, in
the case of a group, to the functional currency of the parent.
An entity shall disclose the following:
(a)
the amount of exchange differences recognised in profit or loss during
the period, except for those arising on financial instruments measured
at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with Section 11
Financial Instruments; and
(b)
the amount of exchange differences arising during the period and
classified in a separate component of equity at the end of the period.
An entity shall disclose the currency in which the financial statements are
presented. When the presentation currency is different from the functional
currency, an entity shall state that fact and shall disclose the functional
currency and the reason for using a different presentation currency.
When there is a change in the functional currency of either the reporting
entity or a significant foreign operation, the entity shall disclose that fact and
the reason for the change in functional currency.
When an entity estimates a spot exchange rate because a currency is not
exchangeable into another currency (see paragraph 30.5A), the entity shall
disclose:
(a)
the currency and a description of the restrictions that result in that
currency not being exchangeable into the other currency;
(b)
a description of affected transactions;
(c)
the carrying amount of affected assets and liabilities;
(d)
the spot exchange rates used and whether those rates are:
(i)

 Appendix to Section 30
Application guidance
This appendix is an integral part of Section 30.
Exchangeability
The purpose of this application guidance is to help entities assess whether a
currency is exchangeable (see paragraphs 30A.2–30A.11) and to estimate the
spot exchange rate when a currency is not exchangeable (see paragraphs
30A.12–30A.18).
Step 1—Assessing whether a currency is exchangeable
A currency is exchangeable into another currency when an entity is able to
obtain the other currency within a time frame that allows for a normal
administrative delay and through a market or exchange mechanism in which
an exchange transaction would create enforceable rights and obligations. An
entity assesses whether a currency is exchangeable into another currency:
(a)
at a measurement date; and
(b)
for a specified purpose.
If an entity is able to obtain no more than an insignificant amount of the
other currency at the measurement date for the specified purpose, the
currency is not exchangeable into the other currency.
An entity might determine that a currency is not exchangeable into another
currency, even though that other currency might be exchangeable in the
other direction. For example, an entity might determine that currency PC is
not exchangeable into currency LC, even though currency LC is exchangeable
into currency PC.
Time frame
A spot exchange rate is the exchange rate for immediate delivery. However, an
exchange transaction might not always complete instantaneously because of
legal or regulatory requirements, or for practical reasons such as public
holidays. A normal administrative delay in obtaining the other currency does
not preclude a currency from being exchangeable into that other currency.
What constitutes a normal administrative delay depends on the facts and
circumstances surrounding the exchange transaction.
Ability to obtain the other currency
In assessing whether a currency is exchangeable into another currency, an
entity shall consider its ability to obtain the other currency (either directly or
indirectly), instead of its intention or decision to do so. For example, subject to
the other requirements in paragraphs 30A.2–30A.11, regardless of whether
the entity intends or decides to obtain currency PC, currency LC is
exchangeable into currency PC if the entity is able either (directly) to exchange
30A.1
30A.2
30A.3
30A.4
30A.5
30A.6
IFRS FOR SMES ACCOUNTING STANDARD
© IFRS Foundation
255
 LC for PC, or (indirectly) to exchange LC for another currency (FC) and then
exchange FC for PC.
Markets or exchange mechanisms
In assessing whether a currency is exchangeable into another currency, an
entity shall consider only markets or exchange mechanisms in which a
transaction to exchange the currency for the other currency would create
enforceable rights and obligations. Enforceability is a matter of law. Whether
an exchange transaction in a market or exchange mechanism would create
enforceable rights and obligations depends on the facts and circumstances
surrounding the exchange transaction.
Purpose of obtaining the other currency
Exchange rates might vary depending on how the currency is to be used. For
example, the relevant authorities of a jurisdiction might set a preferential
exchange rate for imports of specific goods and a ‘penalty’ exchange rate for
dividend payments to other jurisdictions.
Accordingly, whether a currency is exchangeable into another currency could
depend on the purpose for which an entity obtains (or hypothetically might
need to obtain) the other currency. In assessing exchangeability, an entity
shall assume its purpose in obtaining the other currency is:
(a)
to realise or settle individual foreign currency transactions, assets or
liabilities when the entity reports foreign currency transactions in its
functional currency (see paragraphs 30.6–30.11 and 30.14–30.16).
(b)
to realise or settle its net assets or net liabilities when the entity uses a
presentation currency other than its functional currency (see
paragraphs 30.17–30.21). The entity’s net assets might be realised by,
for example, payment of dividends to its shareholders or disposal of
the investment in the entity by its shareholders.
(c)
to realise or settle its net investment in the foreign operation when the
entity translates the results and financial position of a foreign
operation into the presentation currency (see paragraphs 30.22–30.23).
The entity’s net investment in a foreign operation might be realised by,
for example, receipt of dividends from the foreign operation or
disposal of the investment in the foreign operation.
An entity shall assess whether a currency is exchangeable into another
currency separately for each purpose specified in paragraph 30A.9.
Ability to obtain only limited amounts of the other currency
A currency is not exchangeable into another currency at the measurement
date if, for a purpose specified in paragraph 30A.9, an entity is able to obtain
no more than an insignificant amount of the other currency. For example, an
entity with a functional currency of LC has liabilities denominated in currency
FC. The entity assesses whether the total amount of FC it can obtain for the
purpose of settling those liabilities is no more than an insignificant amount
30A.7
30A.8
30A.9
30A.10
30A.11
FEBRUARY 2025
256
© IFRS Foundation
 compared with the aggregated amount (the sum) of its liability balances
denominated in FC.
Step 2—Estimating the spot exchange rate when a
currency is not exchangeable (paragraph 30.5A)
This Standard does not specify how an entity estimates the spot exchange rate
when a currency is not exchangeable. In estimating the spot exchange rate to
meet the objective in paragraph 30.5A, an entity is permitted to use either:
(a)
an observable exchange rate without adjustment (see paragraphs
30A.13–30A.17); or
(b)
another estimation technique (see paragraph 30A.18).
Using an observable exchange rate without adjustment
Examples of an unadjusted observable exchange rate include:
(a)
a spot exchange rate for a purpose other than that for which an entity
assesses exchangeability (see paragraphs 30A.14–30A.15); and
(b)
the first exchange rate at which an entity is able to obtain the other
currency for the specified purpose after exchangeability of the
currency is restored (the first subsequent exchange rate) (see
paragraphs 30A.16–30A.17).
Using an observable exchange rate for another purpose
A currency that is not exchangeable into another currency for one purpose
might be exchangeable into that currency for another purpose. For example,
an entity might be able to obtain a currency to import specific goods but not
to pay dividends. In such situations, the entity might conclude that an
observable exchange rate for another purpose meets the objective described in
paragraph 30.5A.
An observable exchange rate for another purpose might not reflect the
prevailing economic conditions when, for example:
(a)
the rate includes an ‘incentive’ or ‘penalty’ set to encourage or deter
entities from obtaining the other currency for particular purposes;
(b)
an entity is able to obtain the other currency only for limited purposes
(for example, to import emergency supplies);
(c)
the rate is set through regular interventions by the relevant
authorities; or
(d)
the rate is unchanged over time instead of being updated daily (or
more frequently).
30A.12
30A.13
30A.14
30A.15
IFRS FOR SMES ACCOUNTING STANDARD
© IFRS Foundation
257
 Using the first subsequent exchange rate
A currency that is not exchangeable into another currency at the
measurement date for a specified purpose might subsequently become
exchangeable into that currency for that purpose. In such situations, an entity
might conclude that the first subsequent exchange rate meets the objective
described in paragraph 30.5A.
The first subsequent exchange rate might not reflect the prevailing economic
conditions when, for example:
(a)
the date at which exchangeability is restored is long after the
measurement date; or
(b)
an economy is subject to hyperinflation or high inflation and prices
often change quickly, perhaps several times a day.
Using another estimation technique
An entity using another estimation technique is permitted to use any
observable exchange rate—including rates from exchange transactions in
markets or exchange mechanisms that do not create enforceable rights and
obligations—and adjust that rate, as necessary, to meet the objective described
in paragraph 30.5A.

 Section 31
Hyperinflation
Scope of this section
This section applies to an entity whose functional currency is the currency of
a hyperinflationary economy. It requires such an entity to prepare financial
statements that have been adjusted for the effects of hyperinflation.
Hyperinflationary economy
This section does not establish an absolute rate at which an economy is
deemed hyperinflationary. An entity shall make that judgement by
considering all available information including, but not limited to, the
following possible indicators of hyperinflation:
(a)
the general population prefers to keep its wealth in non-monetary
assets or in a relatively stable foreign currency. Amounts of local
currency held are immediately invested to maintain purchasing power.
(b)
the general population regards monetary amounts not in terms of the
local currency but in terms of a relatively stable foreign currency.
Prices may be quoted in that currency.
(c)
sales and purchases on credit take place at prices that compensate for
the expected loss of purchasing power during the credit period, even if
the period is short.
(d)
interest rates, wages and prices are linked to a price index.
(e)
the cumulative inflation rate over three years is approaching, or
exceeds, 100 per cent.
Measuring unit in the financial statements
All amounts in the financial statements of an entity whose functional
currency is the currency of a hyperinflationary economy shall be stated in
terms of the measuring unit current at the end of the reporting period. The
comparative information for the previous period required by paragraph 3.14,
and any information presented in respect of earlier periods, shall also be
stated in terms of the measuring unit current at the reporting date.
The restatement of financial statements in accordance with this section
requires the use of a general price index that reflects changes in general
purchasing power. In most economies there is a recognised general price
index, normally produced by the government, that entities will follow.

 Procedures for restating historical cost financial statements
Statement of financial position
Statement of financial position amounts not expressed in terms of the
measuring unit current at the end of the reporting period are restated by
applying a general price index.
Monetary items are not restated because they are expressed in terms of the
measuring unit current at the end of the reporting period. Monetary items are
money held and items to be received or paid in money.
Assets and liabilities linked by agreement to changes in prices, such as
index-linked bonds and loans, are adjusted in accordance with the agreement
and presented at this adjusted amount in the restated statement of financial
position.
All other assets and liabilities are non-monetary:
(a)
some non-monetary items are carried at amounts current at the end of
the reporting period, such as net realisable value and fair value, so
they are not restated. All other non-monetary assets and liabilities are
restated.
(b)
most non-monetary items are carried at cost or cost less depreciation;
hence they are expressed at amounts current at their date of
acquisition. The restated cost, or cost less depreciation, of each item is
determined by applying to its historical cost and accumulated
depreciation the change in a general price index from the date of
acquisition to the end of the reporting period.
(ba)
some non-monetary items are carried at amounts current at dates
other than that of acquisition or the reporting date, for example,
property, plant and equipment that has been revalued at some earlier
date. In these cases, the carrying amounts are restated from the date
of the revaluation.
(c)
the restated amount of a non-monetary item is reduced, in accordance
with Section 27 Impairment of Assets, when it exceeds its recoverable
amount.
At the beginning of the first period of application of this section, the
components of equity, except retained earnings and any revaluation surplus,
are restated by applying a general price index from the dates the components
were contributed or otherwise arose. Any revaluation surplus that arose in
previous periods is eliminated. Restated retained earnings are derived from all
the other amounts in the restated statement of financial position.
At the end of the first period and in subsequent periods, all components of
owners’ equity are restated by applying a general price index from the
beginning of the period or the date of contribution, if later. The changes for
the period in owners’ equity are disclosed in accordance with Section 6
Statement of Changes in Equity and Statement of Income and Retained Earnings.

 Statement of comprehensive income and income
statement
All items in the statement of comprehensive income (and in the income
statement, if presented) shall be expressed in terms of the measuring unit
current at the end of the reporting period. Consequently, all amounts need to
be restated by applying the change in the general price index from the dates
when the items of income and expenses were initially recognised in the
financial statements. If general inflation is approximately even throughout
the period, and the items of income and expense arose approximately evenly
throughout the period, an average rate of inflation may be appropriate.
Statement of cash flows
An entity shall express all items in the statement of cash flows in terms of
the measuring unit current at the end of the reporting period.
Gain or loss on net monetary position
In a period of inflation, an entity holding an excess of monetary assets over
monetary liabilities loses purchasing power, and an entity with an excess of
monetary liabilities over monetary assets gains purchasing power, to the
extent the assets and liabilities are not linked to a price level. An entity shall
include in profit or loss the gain or loss on the net monetary position. An
entity shall offset the adjustment to those assets and liabilities linked by
agreement to changes in prices made in accordance with paragraph 31.7
against the gain or loss on net monetary position.
Economies ceasing to be hyperinflationary
When an economy ceases to be hyperinflationary and an entity discontinues
the preparation and presentation of financial statements prepared in
accordance with this section, it shall treat the amounts expressed in the
presentation currency at the end of the previous reporting period as the basis
for the carrying amounts in its subsequent financial statements.
Disclosures
An entity to which this section applies shall disclose the following:
(a)
the fact that financial statements and other prior period data have
been restated for changes in the general purchasing power of the
functional currency;
(b)
the identity and level of the price index at the reporting date and
changes during the current reporting period and the previous
reporting period; and
(c)
amount of gain or loss on monetary items.

 Section 32
Events after the End of the Reporting Period
Scope of this section
This section defines events after the end of the reporting period and sets out
principles for recognising, measuring and disclosing those events.
Events after the end of the reporting period defined
Events after the end of the reporting period are those events, favourable and
unfavourable, that occur between the end of the reporting period and the date
when the financial statements are authorised for issue. There are two types of
events:
(a)
those that provide evidence of conditions that existed at the end of the
reporting period (adjusting events after the end of the reporting
period); and
(b)
those that are indicative of conditions that arose after the end of the
reporting period (non-adjusting events after the end of the reporting
period).
Events after the end of the reporting period include all events up to the date
when the financial statements are authorised for issue, even if those events
occur after the public announcement of profit or loss or other selected
financial information.
Recognition and measurement
Adjusting events after the end of the reporting period
An entity shall adjust the amounts recognised in its financial statements,
including related disclosures, to reflect adjusting events after the end of the
reporting period.
The following are examples of adjusting events after the end of the reporting
period that require an entity to adjust the amounts recognised in its financial
statements, or to recognise items that were not previously recognised:
(a)
the settlement after the end of the reporting period of a court case that
confirms that the entity had a present obligation at the end of the
reporting period. The entity adjusts any previously recognised
provision related to this court case in accordance with Section 21
Provisions and Contingencies or recognises a new provision. The entity
does not merely disclose a contingent liability. Instead, the settlement
provides additional evidence to be considered in determining the
provision that should be recognised at the end of the reporting period
in accordance with Section 21.
32.1

 (b)
the receipt of information after the end of the reporting period
indicating that an asset was impaired at the end of the reporting
period or that the amount of a previously recognised impairment loss
for that asset needs to be adjusted. For example:
(i)
the bankruptcy of a customer that occurs after the end of the
reporting period usually confirms that a loss existed at the end
of the reporting period on a trade receivable and that the entity
needs to adjust the carrying amount of the trade receivable;
and
(ii)
the sale of inventories after the end of the reporting period
may give evidence about their selling price at the end of the
reporting period for the purpose of assessing impairment at
that date.
(c)
the determination after the end of the reporting period of the cost of
assets purchased, or the proceeds from assets sold, before the end of
the reporting period.
(d)
the determination after the end of the reporting period of the amount
of profit-sharing or bonus payments, if the entity had a legal or
constructive obligation at the end of the reporting period to make
such payments as a result of events before that date (see Section 28
Employee Benefits).
(e)
the discovery of fraud or errors that show that the financial
statements are incorrect.
Non-adjusting events after the end of the reporting period
An entity shall not adjust the amounts recognised in its financial statements
to reflect non-adjusting events after the end of the reporting period.
Examples of non-adjusting events after the end of the reporting period
include:
(a)
a decline in market value of investments between the end of the
reporting period and the date when the financial statements are
authorised for issue. The decline in market value does not normally
relate to the condition of the investments at the end of the reporting
period, but reflects circumstances that have arisen subsequently.
Consequently, an entity does not adjust the amounts recognised in its
financial statements for the investments. Similarly, the entity does not
update the amounts disclosed for the investments as at the end of the
reporting period, although it may need to give additional disclosure in
accordance with paragraph 32.10.
(b)
an amount that becomes receivable as a result of a favourable
judgement or settlement of a court case after the reporting date but
before the financial statements are authorised for issue. This would be
a contingent asset at the reporting date (see paragraph 21.13) and
disclosure may be required by paragraph 21.16. However, agreement
32.6
32.7
IFRS FOR SMES ACCOUNTING STANDARD
© IFRS Foundation
263
 on the amount of damages for a judgement that was reached before
the reporting date, but was not previously recognised because the
amount could not be measured reliably, may constitute an adjusting
event.
Dividends
If an entity declares dividends to holders of its equity instruments after the
end of the reporting period, the entity shall not recognise those dividends as a
liability at the end of the reporting period. The amount of the dividend may
be presented as a segregated component of retained earnings at the end of the
reporting period.
Disclosure
Date of authorisation for issue
An entity shall disclose the date when the financial statements were
authorised for issue and who gave that authorisation. If the entity’s owners or
others have the power to amend the financial statements after issue, the
entity shall disclose that fact.
Non-adjusting events after the end of the reporting period
An entity shall disclose the following for each category of non-adjusting event
after the end of the reporting period:
(a)
the nature of the event; and
(b)
an estimate of its financial effect or a statement that such an estimate
cannot be made.
The following are examples of non-adjusting events after the end of the
reporting period that would generally result in disclosure; the disclosures will
reflect information that becomes known after the end of the reporting period
but before the financial statements are authorised for issue:
(a)
a major business combination or disposal of a major subsidiary;
(b)
announcement of a plan to discontinue an operation;
(c)
major purchases of assets, disposals or plans to dispose of assets, or
expropriation of major assets by government;
(d)
the destruction of a major production plant by a fire;
(e)
announcement, or commencement of the implementation, of a major
restructuring;
(f)
issues or repurchases of an entity’s debt or equity instruments;
(g)
abnormally large changes in asset prices or foreign exchange rates;
(h)
changes in tax rates or tax laws enacted or announced that have a
significant effect on current and deferred tax assets and liabilities;

 (i)
entering into significant commitments or contingent liabilities, for
example, by issuing significant guarantees; and
(j)
commencement of major litigation arising solely out of events that
occurred after the end of the reporting period.

 Section 33
Related Party Disclosures
Scope of this section
This section requires an entity to include in its financial statements the
disclosures necessary to draw attention to the possibility that its financial
position and profit or loss have been affected by the existence of related
parties and by transactions and outstanding balances with such parties.
Related party defined
A related party is a person or entity that is related to the reporting entity:
(a)
a person or a close member of that person’s family is related to a
reporting entity if that person:
(i)
is a member of the key management personnel of the reporting
entity or of a parent of the reporting entity;
(ii)
has control or joint control over the reporting entity; or
(iii)
has significant influence over the reporting entity.
(b)
an entity is related to a reporting entity if any of the following
conditions applies:
(i)
the entity and the reporting entity are members of the same
group (which means that each parent, subsidiary and fellow
subsidiary is related to the others).
(ii)
one entity is an associate or jointly controlled entity of the
other entity (or an associate or jointly controlled entity of a
member of a group of which the other entity is a member).
(iii)
both entities are jointly controlled entities of the same third
entity.
(iv)
one entity is a jointly controlled entity of a third entity and the
other entity is an associate of the third entity.
(v)
the entity is a post-employment benefit plan for the benefit of
employees of either the reporting entity or an entity related to
the reporting entity. If the reporting entity is itself such a plan,
the sponsoring employers are also related to the reporting
entity.
(vi)
the entity is controlled or jointly controlled by a person
identified in (a).
(vii)
the entity, or any member of a group of which it is a part,
provides key management personnel services to the reporting
entity or to the parent of the reporting entity.
33.1
33.2
FEBRUARY 2025
266
© IFRS Foundation
 (viii)
a person identified in (a)(ii) has significant influence over the
entity or is a member of the key management personnel of the
entity (or of a parent of the entity).
In considering each possible related party relationship, an entity shall assess
the substance of the relationship and not merely the legal form.
In the context of this Standard, the following are not necessarily related
parties:
(a)
two entities simply because they have a director or other member of
key management personnel in common;
(b)
two parties simply because they share joint control over a jointly
controlled entity;
(c)
any of the following simply by virtue of their normal dealings with an
entity (even though they may affect the freedom of action of an entity
or participate in its decision-making process):
(i)
providers of finance;
(ii)
trade unions;
(iii)
public utilities; or
(iv)
government departments and agencies.
(d)
a customer, supplier, franchisor, distributor or general agent with
whom an entity transacts a significant volume of business, merely by
virtue of the resulting economic dependence.
Disclosures
Disclosure of controlling party relationships
Relationships between a parent and its subsidiaries shall be disclosed
irrespective of whether there have been related party transactions. An entity
shall disclose the name of its parent and, if different, the ultimate controlling
party. If neither the entity’s parent nor the ultimate controlling party
produces financial statements available for public use, the name of the next
most senior parent that does so (if any) shall also be disclosed.
Disclosure of key management personnel compensation
Key management personnel are those persons having authority and
responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the
entity, directly or indirectly, including any director (whether executive or
otherwise) of that entity. Compensation includes all employee benefits (as
defined in Section 28 Employee Benefits) including those in the form of share-
based payment (see Section 26 Share-based Payment). Employee benefits include
all forms of consideration paid, payable or provided by the entity, or on behalf
of the entity (for example, by its parent or by a shareholder), in exchange for
services rendered to the entity. It also includes such consideration paid on
33.3
33.4
33.5
33.6
IFRS FOR SMES ACCOUNTING STANDARD
© IFRS Foundation
267
 behalf of a parent of the entity in respect of goods or services provided to the
entity.
An entity shall disclose key management personnel compensation in total.
An entity that obtains key management personnel services from another
entity (management entity) is not required to make any disclosure that might
otherwise be required by paragraph 33.7 in relation to the compensation paid
or payable by the management entity to the management entity’s employees
or directors. However, the amounts incurred by the entity for the provision by
a separate management entity of such services shall be disclosed.
Disclosure of related party transactions
A related party transaction is a transfer of resources, services or obligations
between a reporting entity and a related party, regardless of whether a price is
charged. Examples of related party transactions that are common to SMEs
include, but are not limited to:
(a)
transactions between an entity and its principal owner(s);
(b)
transactions between an entity and another entity when both entities
are under the common control of a single entity or person; and
(c)
transactions in which an entity or person that controls the reporting
entity incurs expenses directly that otherwise would have been borne
by the reporting entity.
If an entity has related party transactions, it shall disclose the nature of the
related party relationship as well as information about the transactions,
outstanding balances and commitments necessary for an understanding of the
potential effect of the relationship on the financial statements. Those
disclosure requirements are in addition to the requirements in paragraph 33.7
to disclose key management personnel compensation. At a minimum,
disclosures shall include:
(a)
the amount of the transactions;
(b)
the amount of outstanding balances, including commitments and:
(i)
their terms and conditions, including whether they are secured
and the nature of the consideration to be provided in
settlement; and
(ii)
details of any guarantees given or received.
(c)
provisions for uncollectable receivables related to the amount of
outstanding balances; and
(d)
the expense recognised during the period in respect of bad or doubtful
debts due from related parties.
Such transactions could include purchases, sales or transfers of goods or
services; leases; guarantees; and settlements by the entity on behalf of the
related party or vice versa.
33.7
33.7A
33.8
33.9
FEBRUARY 2025
268
© IFRS Foundation
 An entity shall make the disclosures required by paragraph 33.9 separately for
each of the following categories:
(a)
entities with control, joint control or significant influence over the
entity;
(b)
entities over which the entity has control, joint control or significant
influence;
(c)
key management personnel of the entity or its parent (in the
aggregate); and
(d)
other related parties.
An entity is exempt from the disclosure requirements of paragraph 33.9 in
relation to related party transactions and outstanding balances, including
commitments, with:
(a)
a government that has control, joint control or significant influence
over the reporting entity; and
(b)
another entity that is a related party because the same government has
control, joint control or significant influence over both the reporting
entity and the other entity.
The following are examples of transactions that shall be disclosed if they are
with a related party:
(a)
purchases or sales of goods (finished or unfinished);
(b)
purchases or sales of property and other assets;
(c)
rendering or receiving of services;
(d)
leases;
(e)
transfers of research and development;
(f)
transfers under licence agreements;
(g)
transfers under finance arrangements (including loans and equity
contributions in cash or in kind);
(h)
provision of guarantees or collateral;
(ha)
commitments to do something if a particular event occurs or does not
occur in the future;
(i)
settlement of liabilities on behalf of the entity or by the entity on
behalf of another party; and
(j)
participation by a parent or subsidiary in a defined benefit plan that
shares risks between group entities.
An entity shall not state that related party transactions were made on terms
equivalent to those that prevail in arm’s length transactions unless such terms
can be substantiated.

 An entity may disclose items of a similar nature in the aggregate except when
separate disclosure is necessary for an understanding of the effects of related
party transactions on the financial statements of the entity.
If a reporting entity applies the exemption in paragraph 33.11, it shall disclose
the following about the transactions and related outstanding balances
referred to in paragraph 33.11:
(a)
the name of the government and the nature of its relationship with
the reporting entity (that is, control, joint control or significant
influence).
(b)
the nature and amount of each individually significant transaction.
(c)
for transactions that are collectively, but not individually, significant, a
qualitative or quantitative indication of their extent. Types of
transactions include those listed in paragraph 33.12.

 Section 34
Specialised Activities
Scope of this section
This section provides guidance on financial reporting by SMEs involved in
three types of specialised activities—agriculture, extractive activities, and
service concessions.
Agriculture
An entity applying this Standard that is engaged in agricultural activity shall
determine its accounting policy for each class of its biological assets, except
for bearer plants that can be measured separately from the produce on them
without undue cost or effort (see paragraph 34.2A), as follows:
(a)
the entity shall use the fair value model in paragraphs 34.4–34.7 for
those biological assets for which fair value is readily determinable
without undue cost or effort; and
(b)
the entity shall use the cost model in paragraphs 34.8–34.10 for all
other biological assets.
This section does not apply to bearer plants that, at initial recognition, can be
measured, both initially and on an ongoing basis, separately from the produce
on them without undue cost or effort (see Section 17 Property, Plant and
Equipment). However, this section applies to the produce on those bearer
plants. If, at initial recognition, an entity determines that bearer plants cannot
be measured separately from the produce on them without undue cost or
effort initially or on an ongoing basis, this section applies to the entire plant.
Examples of plants that are not bearer plants:
(a)
plants cultivated to be harvested as agricultural produce (for example,
trees grown for use as lumber or trees that are cultivated both for their
fruit and for their lumber); and
(b)
annual crops (for example, maize and wheat).
Recognition
An entity shall recognise a biological asset or agricultural produce when, and
only when:
(a)
the entity controls the asset as a result of past events;
(b)
it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the asset
will flow to the entity; and
(c)
the fair value or cost of the asset can be measured reliably without
undue cost or effort.

271
 Measurement—fair value model
An entity shall measure a biological asset on initial recognition and at each
reporting date at its fair value less costs to sell. Changes in fair value less
costs to sell shall be recognised in profit or loss.
Agricultural produce harvested from an entity’s biological assets shall be
measured at its fair value less costs to sell at the point of harvest. Such
measurement is the cost at that date when applying Section 13 Inventories or
another applicable section of this Standard.
Section 12 Fair Value Measurement provides guidance on fair value
measurement.
Disclosures—fair value model
An entity shall disclose the following with respect to its biological assets
measured at fair value:
(a)
a description of each class of its biological assets.
(b)
[deleted]
(c)
a reconciliation of changes in the carrying amount of biological assets
between the beginning and the end of the current period. The
reconciliation shall include:
(i)
the gain or loss arising from changes in fair value less costs to
sell;
(ii)
increases resulting from purchases;
(iii)
decreases resulting from harvest;
(iv)
increases resulting from business combinations;
(v)
net exchange differences arising on the translation of financial
statements into a different presentation currency and on the
translation of a foreign operation into the presentation
currency of the reporting entity; and
(vi)
other changes.
This reconciliation need not be presented for prior periods.
Measurement—cost model
The entity shall measure at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any
accumulated impairment losses those biological assets whose fair value is not
readily determinable without undue cost or effort.
The entity shall measure agricultural produce harvested from its biological
assets at fair value less estimated costs to sell at the point of harvest. Such
measurement is the cost at that date when applying Section 13 or other
sections of this Standard.

 Disclosures—cost model
An entity shall disclose the following with respect to its biological assets
measured using the cost model:
(a)
a description of each class of its biological assets;
(b)
an explanation of why fair value cannot be measured reliably without
undue cost or effort;
(c)
the depreciation method used;
(d)
the useful lives or the depreciation rates used; and
(e)
the gross carrying amount and the accumulated depreciation
(aggregated with accumulated impairment losses) at the beginning and
end of the period.
Exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources
An entity using this Standard that is engaged in the exploration for, or
evaluation of, mineral resources shall determine an accounting policy that
specifies which expenditures are recognised as exploration and evaluation
assets in accordance with paragraph 10.4 and apply the policy consistently. An
entity is exempt from applying paragraph 10.5 to its accounting policies for
the recognition and measurement of exploration and evaluation assets.
The following are examples of expenditures that might be included in the
initial measurement of exploration and evaluation assets (the list is not
exhaustive):
(a)
acquisition of rights to explore;
(b)
topographical, geological, geochemical and geophysical studies;
(c)
exploratory drilling;
(d)
trenching;
(e)
sampling; and
(f)
activities in relation to evaluating the technical feasibility and
commercial viability of extracting a mineral resource.
Expenditures related to the development of mineral resources shall not be
recognised as exploration and evaluation assets.
Exploration and evaluation assets shall be measured on initial recognition at
cost. After initial recognition, an entity shall apply Section 17 and Section 18
Intangible Assets other than Goodwill to the exploration and evaluation assets
according to the nature of the assets acquired subject to paragraphs
34.11D–34.11F. If an entity has an obligation to dismantle or remove an item,
or to restore the site, such obligations and costs are accounted for in
accordance with Section 17 and Section 21 Provisions and Contingencies.
34.10
34.11
34.11A
34.11B
IFRS FOR SMES ACCOUNTING STANDARD
© IFRS Foundation
273
 Exploration and evaluation assets shall be assessed for impairment when facts
and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of an exploration and
evaluation asset may exceed its recoverable amount. An entity shall measure,
present and disclose any resulting impairment loss in accordance with
Section 27 Impairment of Assets, except as provided by paragraph 34.11F.
For the purposes of exploration and evaluation assets only, paragraph 34.11E
shall be applied instead of paragraphs 27.7–27.10 when identifying an
exploration and evaluation asset that may be impaired. Paragraph 34.11E uses
the term ‘assets’ but applies equally to separate exploration and evaluation
assets or a cash-generating unit.
One or more of the following facts and circumstances indicate that an entity
should test exploration and evaluation assets for impairment (the list is not
exhaustive):
(a)
the period for which the entity has the right to explore in the specific
area has expired during the period, or will expire in the near future,
and is not expected to be renewed;
(b)
substantive expenditure on further exploration for, and evaluation of,
mineral resources in the specific area is neither budgeted nor planned;
(c)
exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources in the specific area
have not led to the discovery of commercially viable quantities of
mineral resources and the entity has decided to discontinue such
activities in the specific area; or
(d)
sufficient data exists to indicate that, although a development in the
specific area is likely to proceed, the carrying amount of the
exploration and evaluation asset is unlikely to be recovered in full
from successful development or by sale.
The entity shall perform an impairment test, and recognise any impairment
loss, in accordance with Section 27.
An entity shall determine an accounting policy for allocating exploration and
evaluation assets to cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units
for the purpose of assessing such assets for impairment.
An entity shall treat exploration and evaluation assets as a separate class of
assets and make the disclosures required by either Section 17 or Section 18
consistent with how the assets are classified.
Service concession arrangements
A service concession arrangement is an arrangement whereby a government
or other public sector body (the grantor) contracts with a private operator to
develop (or upgrade), operate and maintain the grantor’s infrastructure assets
such as roads, bridges, tunnels, airports, energy distribution networks, prisons
or hospitals. In those arrangements, the grantor controls or regulates what
services the operator must provide using the assets, to whom, and at what
34.11C

34.11G

© IFRS Foundation
 price, and also controls any significant residual interest in the assets at the
end of the term of the arrangement.
There are two principal categories of service concession arrangements:
(a)
in one, the operator receives a financial asset—an unconditional
contractual right to receive a specified or determinable amount of cash
or another financial asset from the government in return for
constructing or upgrading a public sector asset, and then operating
and maintaining the asset for a specified period of time. This category
includes guarantees by the government to pay for any shortfall
between amounts received from users of the public service and
specified or determinable amounts.
(b)
in the other, the operator receives an intangible asset—a right to
charge for use of a public sector asset that it constructs or upgrades
and then operates and maintains for a specified period of time. A right
to charge users is not an unconditional right to receive cash because
the amounts are contingent on the extent to which the public uses the
service.
Sometimes, a single contract may contain both types: to the extent that the
government has given an unconditional guarantee of payment for the
construction of the public sector asset, the operator has a financial asset; to
the extent that the operator has to rely on the public using the service in
order to obtain payment, the operator has an intangible asset.
Accounting—financial asset model
The operator shall recognise a financial asset to the extent that it has an
unconditional contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset from
or at the direction of the grantor for the construction services. The operator
shall measure the financial asset at fair value. Thereafter, it shall follow
Section 11 Financial Instruments in accounting for the financial asset.
Accounting—intangible asset model
The operator shall recognise an intangible asset to the extent that it receives a
right (a licence) to charge users of the public service. The operator shall
initially measure the intangible asset at fair value. Thereafter, it shall follow
Section 18 in accounting for the intangible asset.
Operating revenue
The operator of a service concession arrangement shall recognise, measure
and disclose revenue in accordance with Section 23 Revenue from Contracts with
Customers for the services it performs.

 Section 35
Transition to the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard
Scope of this section
This section applies to a first-time adopter of the IFRS for SMEs Accounting
Standard, regardless of whether its previous accounting framework was full
IFRS Accounting Standards or another set of generally accepted accounting
principles (GAAP) such as its national accounting standards or another
framework such as the local income tax basis.
An entity that has applied the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard in a previous
reporting period, but whose most recent previous annual financial
statements did not contain an explicit and unreserved statement of
compliance with the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard, must either apply this
section or apply the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard retrospectively in
accordance with Section 10 Accounting Policies, Estimates and Errors as if the
entity had never stopped applying the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard.
When such an entity does not elect to apply this section, it is still required to
apply the disclosure requirements in paragraph 35.12A in addition to the
disclosure requirements in Section 10.
First-time adoption
A first-time adopter of the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard shall apply this
section in its first financial statements that conform to this Standard.
An entity’s first financial statements that conform to this Standard are the
first annual financial statements in which the entity makes an explicit and
unreserved statement in those financial statements of compliance with the
IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard. Financial statements prepared in
accordance with this Standard are an entity’s first such financial statements
if, for example, the entity:
(a)
did not present financial statements for previous periods;
(b)
presented its most recent previous financial statements under national
requirements that are not consistent with this Standard in all respects;
or
(c)
presented its most recent previous financial statements in conformity
with full IFRS Accounting Standards.
Paragraph 3.17 defines a complete set of financial statements.
Paragraph 3.14 requires an entity to disclose, in a complete set of financial
statements, comparative information in respect of the previous comparable
period for all monetary amounts presented in the financial statements, as well
as specified comparative narrative and descriptive information. An entity may
present comparative information in respect of more than one comparable
prior period. Consequently, an entity’s date of transition to the IFRS for SMEs
Accounting Standard is the beginning of the earliest period for which the
35.1
35.2
35.3
35.4
35.5
35.6
FEBRUARY 2025
276
© IFRS Foundation
 entity presents full comparative information in accordance with this Standard
in its first financial statements that conform to this Standard.
Procedures for preparing financial statements at the date of
transition
Except as provided in paragraphs 35.9–35.11, an entity shall on its date of
transition to the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard (ie the beginning of the
earliest period presented):
(a)
recognise all assets and liabilities whose recognition is required by
the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard;
(b)
not recognise items as assets or liabilities if this Standard does not
permit such recognition;
(c)
reclassify items that it recognised under its previous financial
reporting framework as one type of asset, liability or component of
equity, but are a different type of asset, liability or component of
equity under this Standard; and
(d)
apply this Standard in measuring all recognised assets and liabilities.
The accounting policies that an entity uses on adoption of this Standard may
differ from those that it used for the same date using its previous financial
reporting framework. The resulting adjustments arise from transactions,
other events or conditions before the date of transition to this Standard.
Consequently, an entity shall recognise those adjustments directly in retained
earnings (or, if appropriate, another category of equity) at the date of
transition to this Standard.
On first-time adoption of this Standard, an entity shall not retrospectively
change the accounting that it followed under its previous financial reporting
framework for any of the following transactions:
(a)
derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. Financial
assets and liabilities derecognised under an entity’s previous
accounting framework before the date of transition shall not be
recognised upon adoption of the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard.
Conversely, for financial assets and liabilities that would have been
derecognised under the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard in a
transaction that took place before the date of transition, but that were
not derecognised under an entity’s previous accounting framework, an
entity may choose (a) to derecognise them on adoption of the IFRS for
SMEs Accounting Standard or (b) to continue to recognise them until
disposed of or settled.
(b)
hedge accounting. An entity shall not change its hedge accounting
before the date of transition to the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard
for hedging relationships that no longer exist at the date of transition.
For hedging relationships that exist at the date of transition, the entity
shall follow the hedge accounting requirements of Part II of Section 11
Financial Instruments, including the requirements for discontinuing
35.7
35.8
35.9
IFRS FOR SMES ACCOUNTING STANDARD

277
 hedge accounting for hedging relationships that do not meet the
conditions of Part II of Section 11.
(c)
accounting estimates.
(d)
discontinued operations.
(e)
measuring 
non-controlling 
interests. 
The 
requirements 
of
paragraph 5.6 to allocate profit or loss and total comprehensive
income between non-controlling interest and owners of the parent
shall be applied prospectively from the date of transition to the IFRS for
SMEs Accounting Standard (or from such earlier date as this Standard is
applied to restate business combinations—see paragraph 35.10(a)).
(f)
government loans. A first-time adopter shall apply the requirements in
Section 11 and Section 24 Government Grants prospectively to
government loans existing at the date of transition to this Standard.
Consequently, if a first-time adopter did not, under its previous GAAP,
recognise and measure a government loan on a basis that is consistent
with this Standard, it shall use its previous GAAP carrying amount of
the loan at the date of transition to this Standard as the carrying
amount of the loan at that date and shall not recognise the benefit of
any government loan at a below-market rate of interest as a
government grant.
(g)
completed contracts with customers. An entity shall not restate
contracts that were completed before the date of transition to the IFRS
for SMEs Accounting Standard. A completed contract is a contract for
which the entity has transferred all of the goods or services identified
in accordance with its previous GAAP.
An entity may use one or more of the following exemptions in preparing its
first financial statements that conform to this Standard:
(a)
business combinations. A first-time adopter may elect not to apply
Section 19 Business Combinations and Goodwill to business combinations
that were effected before the date of transition to this Standard.
However, if a first-time adopter restates any business combination to
comply with Section 19, it shall restate all later business combinations.
(b)
share-based payment transactions. A first-time adopter is not
required to apply Section 26 Share-based Payment to equity instruments
that were granted before the date of transition to this Standard, or to
liabilities arising from share-based payment transactions that were
settled before the date of transition to this Standard.
(c)
fair value as deemed cost. A first-time adopter may elect to measure an
item of property, plant and equipment, an investment property or
an intangible asset on the date of transition to this Standard at its fair
value and use that fair value as its deemed cost at that date.
35.10
FEBRUARY 2025
278
© IFRS Foundation
 (d)
revaluation as deemed cost. A first-time adopter may elect to use a
previous GAAP revaluation of an item of property, plant and
equipment, an investment property or an intangible asset at, or before,
the date of transition to this Standard as its deemed cost at the
revaluation date.
(da)
event-driven fair value measurement as deemed cost. A first-time
adopter may have established a deemed cost in accordance with its
previous GAAP for some or all of its assets and liabilities by measuring
them at their fair value at one particular date because of an event, for
example, a valuation of the business, or parts of the business, for the
purposes of a planned sale. If the measurement date:
(i)
is at or before the date of transition to this Standard, the entity
may use such event-driven fair value measurements as deemed
cost at the date of that measurement.
(ii)
is after the date of transition to this Standard, but during the
periods covered by the first financial statements that conform
to this Standard, the event-driven fair value measurements may
be used as deemed cost when the event occurs. An entity shall
recognise the resulting adjustments directly in retained
earnings (or, if appropriate, another category of equity) at the
measurement date. At the date of transition to this Standard,
the entity shall either establish the deemed cost by applying
the criteria in paragraph 35.10(c)–(d) or measure those assets
and liabilities in accordance with the other requirements in
this section.
(e)
cumulative translation differences. Section 30 Foreign Currency
Translation requires an entity to classify some translation differences as
a separate component of equity. A first-time adopter may elect to deem
the cumulative translation differences for all foreign operations to be
zero at the date of transition to the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard
(ie a ‘fresh start’).
(f)
separate financial statements. When an entity prepares separate
financial statements, paragraph 9.26 requires it to account for its
investments in subsidiaries, associates and jointly controlled entities
either:
(i)
at cost less impairment;
(ii)
at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in profit or
loss; or
(iii)
using the equity method following the procedures in
paragraph 14.8.
If a first-time adopter measures such an investment at cost, it shall
measure that investment at one of the following amounts at the date
of transition:
IFRS FOR SMES ACCOUNTING STANDARD
© IFRS Foundation
279
 (i)
cost determined in accordance with Section 9 Consolidated and
Separate Financial Statements; or
(ii)
deemed cost, which shall be either fair value at the date of
transition to the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard or previous
GAAP carrying amount on that date.
(g)
compound financial instruments. Paragraph 22.13 requires an entity
to split a compound financial instrument into its liability and equity
components at the date of issue. A first-time adopter need not separate
those two components if the liability component is not outstanding at
the date of transition to this Standard.
(h)
deferred income tax. A first-time adopter may apply Section 29 Income
Tax prospectively from the date of transition to the IFRS for SMEs
Accounting Standard, while applying the exception in paragraph 29.3A
retrospectively.
(i)
service concession arrangements. A first-time adopter is not required
to apply paragraphs 34.12–34.16 to service concession arrangements
entered into before the date of transition to this Standard.
(j)
extractive activities. A first-time adopter using full cost accounting
under previous GAAP may elect to measure oil and gas assets (those
used in the exploration, evaluation, development or production of oil
and gas) on the date of transition to the IFRS for SMEs Accounting
Standard at the amount determined under the entity’s previous GAAP.
The entity shall test those assets for impairment at the date of
transition to this Standard in accordance with Section 27 Impairment of
Assets.
(k)
arrangements containing a lease. A first-time adopter may elect to
determine whether an arrangement existing at the date of transition to
the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard contains a lease (see
paragraph 20.3) on the basis of facts and circumstances existing at that
date, instead of when the arrangement was entered into.
(l)
decommissioning liabilities included in the cost of property, plant and
equipment. Paragraph 17.10(c) states that the cost of an item of
property, plant and equipment includes the initial estimate of the costs
of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which
it is located, the obligation for which an entity incurs either when the
item is acquired or as a consequence of having used the item during a
particular period for purposes other than to produce inventories
during that period. A first-time adopter may elect to measure this
component of the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment at
the date of transition to the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard, instead
of on the date(s) when the obligation initially arose.
(m)
operations subject to rate regulation. If a first-time adopter holds items
of property, plant and equipment or intangible assets that are used, or
were previously used, in operations subject to rate regulation (ie to
provide goods or services to customers at prices/rates established by an
FEBRUARY 2025
280
© IFRS Foundation
 authorised body) it may elect to use the previous GAAP carrying
amount of those items at the date of transition to this Standard as
their deemed cost. If an entity applies this exemption to an item, it
need not apply it to all items. The entity shall test those assets for
impairment at the date of transition to this Standard in accordance
with Section 27.
(n)
severe hyperinflation. If a first-time adopter has a functional
currency that was subject to severe hyperinflation:
(i)
if its date of transition to this Standard is on, or after, the
functional currency normalisation date, the entity may elect
to measure all assets and liabilities held before the functional
currency normalisation date at fair value on the date of
transition to this Standard and use that fair value as the
deemed cost of those assets and liabilities at that date; and
(ii)
if the functional currency normalisation date falls within a
twelve month comparative period, an entity may use a
comparative period of less than twelve months, provided that a
complete 
set 
of 
financial 
statements 
(as 
required 
by
paragraph 3.17) is provided for that shorter period.
(o)
revenue. A first-time adopter is permitted to apply Section 23 Revenue
from Contracts with Customers either retrospectively or prospectively in
accordance with paragraph A27. The entity shall treat references to the
date of initial application, in paragraphs A27, A32, A35 and A36, as
referring to the date of transition to this Standard. The first-time
adopter is not required to provide the disclosure in paragraph A31.
If it is impracticable for an entity to make one or more of the adjustments
required by paragraph 35.7 at the date of transition, the entity shall apply
paragraphs 35.7–35.10 for such adjustments in the earliest period for which it
is practicable to do so, and shall identify which amounts in the financial
statements have not been restated. If it is impracticable for an entity to
provide any of the disclosures required by this Standard, including those for
comparative periods, the omission shall be disclosed.
Disclosures
Explanation of transition to the IFRS for SMEs
Accounting Standard
An entity shall explain how the transition from its previous financial
reporting framework to this Standard affected its reported financial position,
financial performance and cash flows.
An entity that has applied the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard in a previous
period, as described in paragraph 35.2, shall disclose:
(a)
the reason it stopped applying the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard;
35.11
35.12
35.12A
IFRS FOR SMES ACCOUNTING STANDARD
© IFRS Foundation
281
 (b)
the reason it is resuming the application of the IFRS for SMEs
Accounting Standard; and
(c)
whether it has applied this section or has applied the IFRS for SMEs
Accounting Standard retrospectively in accordance with Section 10.
Reconciliations
To comply with paragraph 35.12, an entity’s first financial statements
prepared using this Standard shall include:
(a)
a description of the nature of each change in accounting policy;
(b)
reconciliations of its equity determined in accordance with its previous
financial reporting framework to its equity determined in accordance
with this Standard for both of the following dates:
(i)
the date of transition to this Standard; and
(ii)
the end of the latest period presented in the entity’s most
recent annual financial statements determined in accordance
with its previous financial reporting framework.
(c)
a reconciliation of the profit or loss determined in accordance with its
previous financial reporting framework for the latest period in the
entity’s most recent annual financial statements to its profit or loss
determined in accordance with this Standard for the same period.
If an entity becomes aware of errors made under its previous financial
reporting framework, the reconciliations required by paragraph 35.13(b) and
(c) shall, to the extent practicable, distinguish the correction of those errors
from changes in accounting policies.
If an entity did not present financial statements for previous periods, it shall
disclose that fact in its first financial statements that conform to this
Standard.

 Appendix A
Effective date and transition
This appendix is an integral part of the Standard.
Effective date
The third edition of the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard issued in February
2025 amended and revised sections of the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard.
An entity shall apply the amended and revised sections for annual periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2027. Earlier application is permitted. If an
entity applies the third edition of the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard for an
earlier period, the entity shall disclose that fact.
Transition
An entity shall retrospectively apply the amended and revised sections in the
third edition of the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard in accordance with
Section 10 Accounting Policies, Estimates and Errors except as stated in paragraphs
A3–A49. In paragraphs A4–A49, the date of initial application is the beginning
of the reporting period in which an entity first applies the third edition of the
Standard.
An entity need not disclose the information required by paragraph 10.13(b) for
the current period. Furthermore, if an entity has not restated comparative
information in accordance with the requirements in this appendix, the entity
is not required to disclose the amount of the adjustment for each affected line
item for prior periods in accordance with paragraphs 10.13(b)–(c).
Materiality
An entity shall prospectively apply the amended requirements in paragraphs
3.15A–3.16 from the date of initial application.
Control model
If an entity applies the amended requirements in Section 9 Consolidated and
Separate Financial Statements at the date of initial application and as a result
consolidates an investee not previously consolidated, the entity shall:
(a)
measure the assets, liabilities and non-controlling interests
(including goodwill, if the investee is a business) as if the investee had
been consolidated from the date the entity obtained control. The
investor shall adjust retrospectively the annual period immediately
preceding the date of initial application. When the date the investor
obtained control is earlier than the beginning of that period, the
investor shall recognise, as an adjustment to equity at the beginning of
that period, any difference between:
(i)
the amount of assets, liabilities and non-controlling interests
recognised; and
A1
A2
A3
A4
A5
IFRS FOR SMES ACCOUNTING STANDARD
© IFRS Foundation
283
 (ii)
the previous carrying amount of the investor’s involvement
with the investee.
(b)
if (a) is impracticable, make the adjustments required by paragraph (a)
from the earliest period practicable, which might be the current
period.
If an entity applies the amended requirements in Section 9 at the date of
initial application and as a result no longer consolidates an investee it
previously consolidated, the entity shall:
(a)
measure its interest in the investee as the amount the entity would
have measured if the requirements in Section 9 had been effective
when the entity initially recognised the investee. The entity shall
adjust retrospectively the annual period immediately preceding the
date of initial application. The entity shall also recognise as an
adjustment to equity at the beginning of that period any difference
between:
(i)
the previous carrying amount of the assets, liabilities and
non-controlling interests; and
(ii)
the recognised amount of the interest in the investee.
(b)
if measuring the interest in the investee in accordance with (a) is
impracticable, make the adjustments required by paragraph (a) from
the earliest period practicable, which might be the current period.
If an entity applies paragraph A6(a) and applies the cost model in accordance
with paragraph 14.4 or 15.9 and it is impracticable to determine the cost at
the date of purchase, the entity is permitted to measure the cost (deemed cost)
as either:
(a)
fair value at the date of initial application; or
(b)
the aggregate of the carrying amounts at the date of initial application
of the assets and liabilities, including goodwill, that the entity had
previously consolidated.
At the date of initial application an entity is not required to make adjustments
for previous accounting periods for its involvement in entities that:
(a)
would have been consolidated before the date of initial application and
are still consolidated applying the amended requirements in Section 9;
and
(b)
would not have been consolidated before the date of initial application
and are not consolidated applying the amended requirements in
Section 9.
An entity applying the amended requirements in Section 9 is only required to
disclose the amount of the adjustment for each line item affected in
accordance with paragraph 10.13(b) for the annual period immediately
preceding the date of initial application (and not earlier comparative periods),
A6

 and only if it has restated comparative information in accordance with this
appendix.
An entity shall not restate the carrying amount of an investment in a former
subsidiary if the entity lost control before the date of initial application. In
addition, an entity shall not remeasure any gain or loss on the loss of control
of a former subsidiary that occurred before the date of initial application. An
entity is not required to apply the disclosure requirements in paragraph 9.23B
to comparative information provided for periods before the date of initial
application.
Transition from IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition
and Measurement
An entity that previously applied the recognition and measurement
requirements in IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement shall
retrospectively apply the recognition and measurement requirements in
Section 11 Financial Instruments in accordance with Section 10. However, such
an entity shall:
(a)
not recognise financial assets and liabilities derecognised in accordance
with IAS 39 before the date of initial application. If the entity did not
derecognise financial assets and liabilities in accordance with IAS 39
that would have been derecognised in accordance with Section 11 in a
transaction before the date of initial application, the entity is
permitted:
(i)
to derecognise these financial assets and liabilities on the date
of initial application; or
(ii)
to continue to recognise these financial assets and liabilities
until they are disposed of or settled.
(b)
assess whether a financial asset meets the conditions described in
paragraphs 11.9–11.9ZA based on the facts and circumstances at the
date of initial application. The entity shall retrospectively apply the
resulting classification.
(c)
if it is impracticable to apply retrospectively the effective interest
method, treat the fair value of the financial asset or the financial
liability:
(i)
at the end of each comparative period as the gross carrying
amount of that financial asset or the amortised cost of that
financial liability; and
(ii)
at the date of initial application as the new gross carrying
amount of that financial asset or the new amortised cost of that
financial liability at the date of initial application.
(d)
prospectively apply the hedge accounting requirements in Part II of
Section 11 from the date of initial application. An entity shall leave
unchanged until the date of initial application its hedge accounting for
hedging relationships that no longer exist at the date of initial
A10

285
 application in accordance with the third edition of the Standard. For
hedging relationships that exist at the date of initial application, the
entity shall follow the hedge accounting requirements in Section 11,
including the requirements for discontinuing hedge accounting for
hedging relationships that do not meet the conditions described in
Section 11.
Fair value measurement
An entity shall prospectively apply the new Section 12 Fair Value Measurement
and paragraph 2.89 from the date of initial application.
An entity is not required to apply the disclosure requirements in the new
Section 12 to comparative information provided for periods before the date of
initial application.
The new Section 12 amended paragraphs 11.14(c), 11.43, 11.57, 13.3(a), 14.10,
14.15, 15.15, 15.21, 16.7, 17.15B, 27.9(c), 27.14, 28.15(b), 34.4 and 34.6; deleted
paragraphs 11.27–11.32, 12.12, 16.10(a), 17.33(c) and 34.7(b); and added
paragraphs 26.1D–26.1E. An entity shall also prospectively apply those
amendments from the date of initial application.
Joint arrangements
An entity applying the amended requirements in Section 15 Joint Arrangements
is only required to disclose the amount of the adjustment for each line item
affected in accordance with paragraph 10.13(b) for the annual period
immediately preceding the date of initial application (and not earlier
comparative periods).
Investment property
Business combinations
An entity shall prospectively apply the requirements in paragraph 16.3A for
acquisitions of investment property on or after the date of initial application.
Transfers of investment property
An entity shall apply the amended requirements in paragraph 16.9 to changes
in use that occur on or after the date of initial application. At the date of
initial application, an entity shall reassess the classification of property held at
that date and, if applicable, reclassify property by applying paragraphs
16.2–16.4 to reflect the conditions that exist at that date.
If an entity reclassifies property at the date of initial application in accordance
with paragraph 16.9, the entity shall disclose the amounts reclassified to or
from investment property as part of the reconciliation between the carrying
amounts of investment property at the beginning and at the end of the period
as required by paragraph 16.10(e).

 Depreciation of property, plant and equipment
An entity shall prospectively apply the amended requirements in paragraphs
17.21–17.22 from the date of initial application.
Amortisation of intangible assets
An entity shall prospectively apply the requirements in paragraph 18.22A
from the date of initial application.
Business combinations and goodwill
An entity shall prospectively apply the revised Section 19 Business Combinations
and Goodwill to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or
after the date of initial application and to asset acquisitions that occur on or
after the date of initial application. The entity is not required to apply the
disclosure requirements in the revised Section 19 to comparative information
provided for periods before the date of initial application.
An entity shall leave unadjusted on the date of initial application assets and
liabilities from business combinations whose acquisition dates preceded the
date of initial application.
The revised Section 19 amended paragraph 11.49(g), added paragraph 21.1(e)
and deleted paragraph 22.2(c). An entity shall prospectively apply those
amendments to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or
after the date of initial application and to asset acquisitions that occur on or
after the date of initial application.
An entity shall not adjust on the date of initial application any contingent
consideration balances arising from business combinations whose acquisition
dates preceded the date of initial application. An entity shall omit these
balances 
from 
the 
information 
it 
discloses 
in 
accordance 
with
paragraph 19.41. An entity shall prospectively apply paragraphs A25–A26
from the date of initial application. Paragraphs A25–A26 refer exclusively to
business combinations whose acquisition dates precede the date of initial
application.
If a business combination agreement provides for an adjustment to the cost of
the combination contingent on future events and the adjustment is probable
and can be measured reliably, the acquirer shall include the amount of that
adjustment in the cost of the business combination at the acquisition date.
However, if a business combination agreement provides for such an
adjustment and the adjustment either is not probable or cannot be measured
reliably, an entity shall not include the adjustment in the cost of the
combination at the time of initially accounting for the combination. If that
adjustment subsequently becomes probable and can be measured reliably, the
entity shall treat the additional consideration as an adjustment to the cost of
the combination.

 Revenue from contracts with customers
An entity shall apply the revised Section 23 Revenue from Contracts with
Customers consistently to all contracts with customers either:
(a)
retrospectively in accordance with Section 10, subject to paragraphs
A28–A31; or
(b)
prospectively from the date of initial application in accordance with
paragraphs A32–A36.
Retrospective application
If an entity retrospectively applies the revised Section 23, it is permitted to use
one or more of three exemptions:
(a)
for completed contracts, an entity is not required to restate contracts
that:
(i)
begin and end within the same reporting period; or
(ii)
were completed at the beginning of the earliest period
presented.
(b)
for completed contracts that have variable consideration, an entity is
permitted to use the transaction price at the date the contracts were
completed instead of estimating amounts of variable consideration for
the comparative reporting periods.
(c)
for contracts that were modified before the beginning of the earliest
period presented, an entity is not required to retrospectively restate
those 
contract 
modifications 
in 
accordance 
with 
paragraphs
23A.3–23A.4. Instead, the entity is permitted to reflect the aggregate
effect of all modifications that occurred before the beginning of the
earliest period presented when it:
(i)
identifies the fulfilled and unfulfilled promises;
(ii)
determines the transaction price; and
(iii)
allocates the transaction price to the fulfilled and unfulfilled
promises.
In paragraph A28(a)–(b), a completed contract is a contract for which the
entity has transferred all goods or services identified in accordance with the
requirements for accounting for revenue from contracts with customers that
were replaced by the revised Section 23.
If an entity uses any of the exemptions in paragraph A28, the entity shall
disclose that fact and apply that exemption consistently to all periods
presented.
An entity retrospectively applying the revised Section 23 shall disclose the
amount of the adjustment for each line item affected for the annual period
immediately preceding the date of initial application and not earlier
comparative periods as required by paragraph 10.13(b).

 Prospective application
If an entity prospectively applies the revised Section 23, the entity shall apply
the revised Section 23 to contracts that begin after the date of initial
application. The entity shall not change its accounting policy for any
contracts in progress at that date.
The revised Section 23 amended paragraphs 4.11(b), 11.13, 11.14(a), 17.29,
18.1, 21.1(b), 27.1(f) and 34.16; deleted paragraphs 13.2(a), 13.14 and 21A.5;
and added paragraphs 11.7(g), 11.7A, 11.13A–11.13B, 11.14A, 11.49(j), 11.55
and 13.2A. If an entity prospectively applies the revised Section 23, the entity
shall apply those amendments in accordance with paragraph A32.
An entity prospectively applying the revised Section 23 shall disclose:
(a)
that it has not restated comparative information as a result of applying
the revised Section 23; and
(b)
the nature of the change in accounting policy.
An entity prospectively applying the revised Section 23 is not required to
apply the disclosure requirements in that section to comparative information
provided for periods before the date of initial application.
In the financial statements for periods in which contracts that were in
progress at the date of initial application remain in progress, an entity
prospectively applying the revised Section 23 shall disclose:
(a)
the accounting policy for the recognition of revenue for those
contracts, including the methods adopted to determine the stage of
completion of transactions involving the rendering of services; and
(b)
the revenue recognised in the current period from those contracts.
Share-based payment
Scope of Section 26 Share-based Payment
An entity shall prospectively apply paragraph 26.1C for transactions occurring
on or after the date of initial application.
Definition of fair value measurement
An entity shall prospectively apply paragraphs 26.1D–26.1E from the date of
initial application.
Definition of a vesting condition
An entity shall prospectively apply the amendments to paragraph 26.9, the
amended definitions of ‘vesting condition’ and ‘market vesting condition’
and the new definitions of ‘performance condition’ and ‘service condition’
to share-based payment transactions with a grant date on or after the date of
initial application.

 Effects of vesting conditions on the measurement of a cash-settled
share-based payment
An entity shall prospectively apply paragraphs 26.14A–26.14B to share-based
payment transactions that are unvested at the date of initial application and
to share-based payment transactions with a grant date on or after the date of
initial application. For unvested share-based payment transactions granted
before the date of initial application, an entity shall remeasure the liability at
that date and recognise the effect of the remeasurement in the opening
balance of retained earnings (or other component of equity, as appropriate) at
the date of initial application.
Share-based payment transactions with a net settlement feature
for withholding tax obligations
An entity shall apply the amended requirements in paragraphs 26.15–26.15D
to share-based payment transactions that are unvested (or vested but
unexercised) at the date of initial application and to share-based payment
transactions with a grant date on or after the date of initial application. For
unvested (or vested but unexercised) share-based payment transactions that
were previously classified as cash-settled but then became classified as
equity-settled in accordance with the amended requirements in paragraphs
26.15–26.15D, an entity shall reclassify the carrying amount of the
share-based payment liability to equity at the date of initial application.
Measurement simplifications for defined benefit
obligations
An entity shall retrospectively apply the amended requirements in
paragraph 28.19 in accordance with Section 10. However, an entity is not
required to adjust the carrying amount of assets in the scope of other sections
of this Standard for changes in employee benefit costs that were included in
the carrying amount before the date of initial application.
Income tax
Recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses
An entity shall retrospectively apply the amended requirements in paragraphs
29.16A, 29.19(a) and 29.19A in accordance with Section 10. However, on initial
application of these amended requirements, an entity is permitted to
recognise the change in the opening equity of the earliest comparative period
in the opening balance of retained earnings (or other component of equity, as
appropriate), without allocating the change between opening retained
earnings and other components of equity. If an entity applies this relief, it
shall disclose that fact.
Uncertainty over income tax treatments
An entity shall retrospectively apply paragraphs 29.34A–29.34D either:
(a)

 (b)
if (a) is impossible without the use of hindsight or is otherwise
impracticable, recognising the cumulative effect of initially applying
paragraphs 29.34A–29.34D as an adjustment to the opening balance of
retained earnings (or other component of equity, as appropriate) at the
date of initial application.
Foreign currency translation
Lack of exchangeability
An entity shall not retrospectively apply paragraph 30.5A. Instead, if the
entity:
(a)
reports foreign currency transactions in its functional currency and
concludes at the date of initial application that the two currencies are
not exchangeable, the entity shall at the date of initial application:
(i)
translate affected foreign currency monetary items and non-
monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency
using the estimated spot exchange rate at that date; and
(ii)
recognise any effect of initially applying the amendments as an
adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings; or
(b)
uses a presentation currency other than its functional currency or
translates the results and financial position of a foreign operation and
concludes at the date of initial application that the functional currency
and presentation currency are not exchangeable, the entity shall at the
date of initial application:
(i)
translate affected assets and liabilities using the estimated spot
exchange rate at that date;
(ii)
translate affected equity items using the estimated spot
exchange rate at that date if the entity’s functional currency is
hyperinflationary; and
(iii)
recognise any effect of initially applying paragraph 30.5A as an
adjustment 
to 
the 
cumulative 
amount 
of

differences, accumulated in a separate component of equity.
An entity is not required to apply the disclosure requirements in
paragraph 30.28 to comparative information provided for periods before the
date of initial application.
Foreign currency transactions and advance consideration
An entity is permitted to prospectively apply paragraph 30.8A to all assets,
expenses and income within the scope of paragraph 30.8A that were initially
recognised on or after either:
(a)
the date of initial application; or
(b)
the beginning of any comparative period presented.

 An entity that applies paragraph A47 shall apply paragraph 30.8A on initial
application to assets, expenses and income initially recognised on or after the
date in paragraph A47(a) or paragraph A47(b) for which the entity has
recognised non-monetary assets or non-monetary liabilities arising from
advance consideration before that date.
Bearer plants
An entity is permitted to measure a bearer plant at its fair value at the
beginning of the earliest period presented and use that fair value as its
deemed cost at that date. The entity shall recognise any difference between
the previous carrying amount and fair value in opening balance of retained
earnings at the beginning of the earliest period presented.
